# Chris Concannon - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I set out to learn JavaScript and hone my professional presence in module 4. I accomplished the JavaScript-related goals through completion of IdeaBox and Game Time. I made much progress on my professional goals through polishing my resume, obtaining outside feedback for technical interviews and resume/cover letter content, and starting the job application process. During Scale Up, I set another goal to learn as much about Android Development as I could for the project. I achieved nearly full points for that project and I am continuing my Android learning for the near future. I am also continuing my job search - to date I have completed several phone interviews and technical challenges related to applications I submitted.

## A: End of Module Assessment

### Instructor Comments
- I'm able to edit links to have bad URLs
- In your flash message, you escape the `c` character by typing `\cc`. `\` needs to be escaped by typing `\\`
- Link index view is clean, but status flag seems unnecessary because you could have just used `link.read` instead of creating a new local variable.
- No tests for supporting feature
- UI looks good, and is easy to use
- It doesn't specifically say so, but you're only searching by title, instead of title and URL. Could be a better UX.

### Detailed Rubric

#### 1. Satisfactory Progress
* **3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5, and one supporting feature, with few bugs and no missing functionality.**

#### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style
* **3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

#### 3. Rails Style & API
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

#### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

#### 5. Testing
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

#### 6. User Interface
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

#### 7. Workflow
* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/ScoreKeeper)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

I was part of the self-driven group "Whiskey Tango" for Scale Up. I learned much about Android App development, and created two simple apps during my learning. I submitted one PR and received valuable feedback from a Turing mentor in California. I also documented my learning via two detailed blog posts on Medium which were both shared and favorited multiple times, and gained me several followers on the site.

I received a total 285/300 points for Scale Up. I had points knocked off mainly because I did not open a PR for review in the first week of the project.

Instructor Notes:
- Blog post is thorough and helpful. I'm not sure the inline images were the best choice. It shrinks the readable area, and makes it a little harder to read.
- Nice progress on an android app, and android development in general.
- I'd recommend adding a README to your android project so you can talk about it.


#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

Idea Box is a single-page web app I created with a Rails backend and JavaScript front-end. We had just a few days to work on the project, and I was unable to implement the full functionality in the spec. I did, however, learn a lot about integrating JavaScript into my views and interacting with the app backend.

I received 115/150 points for Idea Box

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

I partnered with Trent for our Game Time project. We built a single-player miniature golf game using the HTML Canvas and JavaScript. The project was challenging to complete because of our unfamiliarity with JavaScript, but we were able to plan our iterations well and we made constant, valuable progress. By the end of the project, we had a functional game with no major bugs. We were able to enhance gameplay by randomly generating various obstacles. This served as a very valuable lesson in the importance of DRY code and refactoring objects in JavaScript. We used mostly ES6 syntax when creating constructors and assigning properties.

Trent and I received 282/300 points on Game Time

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
    - I personally have never struggled with this topic. I tend to perform well under pressure and I have never had my spirit crushed by failure or criticism. The biggest takeaway I got from the group discussion is that code quality does not necessarily mean that our work will be well-received. As developers we need to build a resilience to keep turning out top work regardless of how it is received by the customers/sales teams/management. Misinterpretations in requirements and communication will occur and we might be criticized and thought to be incompetent, despite our true abilities.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
    - It's important to realize that our industry is more full of introverts compared to the rest of the workforce population in the US, so it's more important than ever to recognize their contributions and ideas. Policies that encourage equal weighting of inputs from people, regardless of the repetition or volume of those inputs, will allow teams to perform better. On the other side, it is important to recognize situations when your personal behaviors are of the introverted variety so that you can also try to develop your own extroversion behaviors. Extroverts are generally interpreted as more correct, more influential, and more valuable to teams.

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
    - I missed this Gear Up because I was traveling out of state for the weekend.

### Job Search
#### Priorities
1. Play the numbers game with applications
    - I have the luxury of being able to move anywhere I want for my future career, and right now I am applying to positions in Colorado and all states west of here.
2. Constantly evolve my skillset and complete projects accordingly
    - I will continue personal learning as I apply to jobs, but I also will factor in the demands I see most often to my goals in personal learning
3. Keep an open mind to all industries if there are learning opportunities
    - I realize that my first year or two will be filled with learning, regardless of the product I am working on. If I am not passionate about the company's product, but they want to hire me, I will gladly learn from their more senior members and continue to pursue my own personal goals on personal time. After the 2-year experience mark, my skillset will be much more marketable to companies where I find my personal passions in alignment with their goals.

#### Current Status
I have completed 4 code challenges and 2 phone interviews to date. I have many more applications outstanding. I will continue applying while I also take on more learning projects. I have plans to continue personal learning projects in the following order:
1. Android App development - make a HR monitoring app for Android Wear and deploy it
2. React.js - redo Rails personal project to use React on the front end
3. Node.js - become proficient with Idea Box and/or URL Lockbox
4. Switch text editor to Emacs (refactor old projects)
5. SQL and noSQL - complete tutorials to improve proficiency
6. Learn Clojure - dive in to functional programming

After completing each one of the above steps, I will modify my resume to reflect recent projects and proficiencies. I will continue drafting cover letters relevant to each position.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback on many PR's and blog posts as part of Scale Up

### Being a Community Member

I received much feedback on my Scale Up PR and blog posts, both from Turing and the outside software development community

### Playing a Part

I continued to be a leader/member of the Friday running group and I assisted multiple back-end mod 1, 2, and 3 students with their homework challenges and projects integrating Google Maps API. I also participated in several paired or group code challenges on Fridays at Gusto.
