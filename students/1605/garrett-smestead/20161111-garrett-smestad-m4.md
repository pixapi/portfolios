## Areas of Emphasis

This module I basically just wanted to try and get a firm grasp on Javascript while not losing all of my knowledge of Rails. This was pretty darned hard, but I think I got to a place where I understand how Javascript works, and I can work in the language "comfortably".

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

### 1. Satisfactory Progress


* **2: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with some _minor_ bugs or missing functionality.**


### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style


* **3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**


### 3. Rails Style & API

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I found this to be a very broad topic to try to cover in an hour or less. I wish we'd had the opportunity to discuss just _one_ of the articles we had to choose from in depth.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This was an interesting session. I definitely consider myself to be introverted. I do enjoy quiet and time alone, but I also very much enjoy social activities with friends. The video helped show that a label is not definitive, and that there are those that exist more in the middle: ambiverts. This was also very similar to an exercise my previous job had us do.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I enjoyed this session. As mentioned in the articles, resilience has become a buzz-topic, and although seemingly well-understood within academia, there are still a number of leadership courses that attempt to teach it for a high fee. I liked that one researcher found that every individual, regardless of their resilience, had a breaking point, and that your level of resilience can vary over time.

### Professional Development Workshops

Be confident, because others are likely having the same issues and are afraid of the same things as you.

### Notes

* Final - Developer considers a small bug in production. - Mailer 
* Module was going fine until Developer really fell short on expectations
* Fell short a bit on group work because of the last week of scale up
* PD sessions were productive and a good use of time. - Comforting
* Score are too far from passing scores for this module
* Developer feels he did work that warrents more points on scale up (Risk Taking)

### Outcome

Fail
