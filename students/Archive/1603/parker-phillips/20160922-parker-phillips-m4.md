# Parker Phillips - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal moving into this Module is being able to effectively implement javascript on the front end and deliver a high-quality GameTime project. I've been looking forward to GameTime since my interview and am excited to see how my JS abilities develop in the short time to deliver something that excites me.

Looking back on the journey here I feel I can say that I have achieved the goals I set out for myself in regards to ability. I am very pleased with GameTime. I feel it was a very valuable experience as I beefed up my JS knowledge significantly and have a project that I am very proud of. I feel very confident in my ability to write vanilla JS, jQuery, make AJAX calls, and develop a professional application using rails with JavaScript. Going forward I would like to learn more about pairing a rails back-end with a JS front-end instead of just using the JS files in rail; I would like to explore React primarily. Overall I feel like this mod was more balanced between features and testing, but still favoring the feature side of things. I'm happy with the progress I've made and am looking forward to see where I can take the skills I've developed here.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Parker-CP/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

IdeaBox was the first project of Module Four. It was a one page application that contained an in-house API. The goal was to manipulate ideas using strictly AJAX and jQuery.     

 Evaluation Score: 146/150

 Spec Adherence - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of format.js in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.     

 UI/UX - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

 Testing - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.     

 Ruby & Rails Quality - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.     

 JS Style - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.     

 Workflow - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Riizu/sloc)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

GameTime was Ryan and I's chance to dive deeper into a more logical side of javascript and work on something we were both passionate about. We decided to build a procedurally generated roguelike. This was accomplished by initially building a cell-based grid, adding cell-detection and values, and randomly building different phases of the map. After the legwork was out of the way, adding features onto the project was an easy and fun last day.

Testing had slipped on this project, but it was sacrificed for bonus features and polish on the game itself, which was demonstrated. It was a slow process to get going, but ended up being a successful gametime.

checkins: 160/150
eval: 140/150
end-result: 300/300

This module, you and I finally had the opportunity to officially work together from day one on a project. I say finally because its no secret that we wanted to do so much sooner, but unfortunately the all mighty shuffle.pop was not on our side.
Being my only group experience in Mod 4, I had nothing to compare this experience to during the module, but I feel safe in saying it was truly wonderful. We spent many hours over many long days, but I think we really meshed in our level of dedication, motivation, and passion. While this could result in the occasional frustration or butting of heads, we always worked through it.
What I was even happier to see though was your growth through the project in two categories. The first was in JavaScript, which you had mentioned during our DTR was a concern for you due to struggles with IdeaBox. Rather than shy away though, you dived head first and often spent additional time outside of our scheduled time improving your personal understanding and skills. This had the excellent side benefit of encouraging me, resulting in a cyclical effect of positivity and growth.
The second of these categories is one that I've talked to you a lot about throughout the course of Turing, and thats self-confidence. From the beginning of the program you always were incredibly talented, so it was a struggle watching you beat yourself up over the little things, or think that you weren't capable of something. While this issue still occurred every so often, you always were receptive to constructive criticism, feedback, and even asked for some of both on your own. You made a conscious decision to tackle a hard challenge, and often became the voice of positivity whenever we struggled.
Going forward, I really urge you to take this change in mindset with you to your first job and beyond. I think that the moment you recognize your strengths you will certainly become a developer that other's look to for guidance, strength, and support.
Thank you for such an awesome experience together, and I'm really rooting for you. - Ryan

#### ScaleUp

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/mentorSHIP_project.markdown)

The MentorSHIP is an application to connect Turing School students and mentors. Students can browse mentors by skills and interest, and view their contact information.

MentorSHIP is an application built with an Ember.js front-end and a rails 5 api backend. The goal behind this project is make it easier for students and mentors to connect with each other. Our primary goal during this project was to build github OAuth on the backend, and have it be functional on the front-end.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

I really started to enjoy this gear up. I felt very excited when I heard what the topic was about; obviously everyone likes being better at difficult things. Personally I enjoy trying to be as good as possible at as much as I can. Which I learned was dangerous. I had never heard of cognitive resources, I assumed everything came from a different place. "Oh I can do this logic puzzle then play this strategy game and have enough mental power for work because those other things were fun." Or something like "I can take all of these hard classes because the subject matter is unrelated"(calc, latin, philosophy, business law). The biggest take away for me was becoming aware when I am spending cognitive resources, but another powerful tool I garnered from this was the knowledge of the different areas. Oftentimes I find myself leaving things that I feel I am very good at unattended because I am already proficient, knowing about all of these columns will be very useful. I do wish the video got into more strategies about how to accomplish this instead of just break them into smaller tasks.

#### There is an I in team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

At this point in time I was feeling incredibly overwhelmed with GameTime. We had done very poorly on our first check-in and were severely behind schedule. I used this time to try and get work done on the project. I maintain that my being at gear-up would have been counter-productive as I would have been tunneled on the stress I was feeling for the project.

#### Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I missed our most recent gear-up because I was getting lunch with Scott Bates from Raytheon.


### Professional Development Workshops
##### Summary
I am a highly motivated software developer driven by a dedication to deliver high-quality and effective solutions. I achieve this through excellent
problem solving, quick pattern recognition, and effective communication. I love learning new skills and value all opportunities I receive to think
outside of the box and implement creative solutions.

##### Experience

I am waiting on receiving a link for the Turing profile, and have not yet updated my LinkedIn, however I do feel that I have developed a strong resume that I have passed to Lia and a few friends in the tech industry. I have crafted that through the course of the module changing it with the feedback I receive from mentors and peers alike.

I also had a one on one with Lia early in the Module to help with cold outreach as this is a pretty shadowy subject for me. I developed a "to-do" list of how to approach the subject. This has been very helpful, and while it has yet to lead me in the direction of a job, I feel much more confident reaching out to people and have established a few useful connections.

The negotiations talk was also a very successful one in my opinion. I have received a lot of advice from my Dad over the years, but he was in a very different environment from tech. Hearing the appropriate questions to ask and reactions to have made me feel much more confident going into negotiation in the future. I am young and this was a pretty intimidating topic.

Along the same lines of intimidation was the actual interview. I have never interviews for anything other than to come to Turing, so I really have no idea what it is going to be like, but being able to talk with Jim about they expect us to konw and how they expect us to act really put my nerves about the subject at ease. I feel prepared to step into my first interview and at the very least not fall completely on my face.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
##### Ryan
Ryan, you are one of my closest friends and I was super stoked when I learned that we were going to be able to choose our partners for GameTime. We hadn't had the opportunity to partner on a project (except for that weird BlackThursday fiasco) but we had helped each other a couple times in the other modules.

I was not feeling very confident in my JS abilities at the start of the project, but you quickly assuaged those feelings. Whether you instilled me with a false confidence until I learned or exposed skill that was there will forever be a mystery to me, but I thank you for doing so. This was by and large my best group experience at Turing. Obviously part of this is due to the fact that we get along very well, but also your willingness to help and your patience when something doesn't click. There were a couple times when we were both high-stressed that those qualities strained for the both of us, but it always seemed to work out in the end. I think we both could've benefitted from better communication during those times and it's definitely something we both need to keep in mind and work on.

Your confidence level with your coding has been something that I truly admire; and none of it I feel is displaced. You are a wildly talented developer and I don't believe there is a problem someone could give you that you couldn't solve. I feel like this module and the last you really ran with that ability. You always succeeded in the first two modules, but lately you've been going above and beyond. From writing your personal project in react native, to developing a swift app, and somehow convince me to dive into a randomly generated roguelike after a week of JS. That drive, passion, and talent should take you as far as you want to go.

##### Chris
Chris! I was really happy when you told me that you were going to be working on the mentorSHIP with me. I wish we would’ve had more time to pair and work together, but it just didn’t really fit with the style of work we had to do. I truly appreciate your willingness to dive into unknown problems and start experimenting to find out what works, as well as your patience with all of my failed experiments. I’ve really enjoyed having you in our module over the last few months and loved to see the growth of technical ability from you during the whole process



### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

This Mod was definitely different. I know going into it we had almost collectively decided as a cohort that we wanted to change the stereotype of the disappearing mod 4, and I personally feel like that was not accomplished. This is partially due to the nature of mod 4 in my opinion. A lot of the work we are given is possible to do remotely, and a lot of time is dedicated to job hunting and professional development. It was not much help either to be so separated from all of the other back end modules.

I attempted to overcome this by making myself accessible to other mods over slack, and during GameTime I paired with mod 1 students whenever I got a chance. I also Co-led Miyamoto with Ryan at the beginning, and assisted in passing the torch to Ryan Workman about halfway through. My largest contribution to the posse this module was getting the actual project off the ground. I helped set up the repository with some base code, as well as professional tools such as hubflow and zenhub. I also taugh a supplimentary lesson over those tools to familiarize the rest of the posse with the git workflow that I felt would make managing a cross-module project easier.
