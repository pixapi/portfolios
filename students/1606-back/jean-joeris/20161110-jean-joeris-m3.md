# Jean Joeris - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for the mod were 3 fold

1) Continue to lead Armstrong Posse and strengthen it
   * I feel I succeeded at this goal. I received very positive feedback about multiple Friday Spike sessions (particularly Python mob programming and perceptron/artifical neuron). I believe it was strengthen because mod 1 and 2 students led a very succesful spike on the AlchemyAPI by themselves. The blog portion of Mind on The Ball will also strengthen Armstrong by serving as a lasting resource past my graduation.

2) Build a machine learning algorithm
   * I wasn't sure if I would do this through Armstrong or the self-directed project. It ended up being a neural net built as the self-directed project. This was incredibly successful. While I feel I have just scratched the surface, Brian and I were able to impliment a working neural net in two weeks. This is made more impressive(?) due to the fact we built in Ruby, a subpar language for the type of algorithm we were building.

3) Lead LGBTuring
   * I did not succeed in this goal. Between the intense workload of mod 3, and dealing with my wife's health problems I let this slip. This was also in part driven by the apparent lack of interest from the community, but in mod 4 I plan to redouble my efforts. This is extremely important to me, as I need to find a younger student to take the reigns of the group.

While I did not meet all of my goals, I am extremely proud of what I did this mod, and believe my code backs this up.

    *   **1: Yes**

#### From Brendan:
You had a really good high-level understanding of how some of the more difficult pieces of our project worked, which was really valuable. In addition, you did a great job of stepping up as the project manager and keeping our workflow organized through waffle. However, whenever we divided up our workflow on a small scale informally, you tended to be a little more scattered. While I respect that jumping between ideas is how you work best, it would be helpful if you were able to better switch into a more organizational project triage mode for stand-ups.

#### From Susi:
Jean - It has been a pleasure working with you on this project. Thank you for stepping up into the Project Management role at the last minute; I really appreciate your flexibility on that. It is not an easy role and you did a great job. As soon as you were asked to be the PM, you dove in, started arranging cards and getting people's tasks lined up. Terrific! You tend to move extremely quickly both in code and speech and slowing down would be a benefit to team mates as well as yourself. At the end of the project when we were working on finishing up the tasks prioritized for us, it was hard to follow the tasks you were planning on taking versus what the other members of the team were supposed to do; it was hard to follow the speed of your thought process. By slowing down we can all start to see the tasks more clearly. Your technical knowledge and ability to look at the project from multiple angles at the same time is amazing and commendable. I can't tell you how much your refactoring improved our project. Thank you for everything.

#### From Ryan:
Jean is one of the most talented people I have ever run into in my professional life. His ability to grasp a concept and understand its function and the logic behind it is uncanny. Specific to this group, Jean stepped up during some difficult emotional hurdles and steered us back onto the path of success. While Jean's ability to grasp technical concepts is incredible, his knowledge can be overwhelming at times. I consider myself a rather confident programmer, and, for me, pairing with him became intimidating at times. Now, I'm not saying he is purposely flaunting his knowledge or intentionally drowning out other voices, I just think his excitement for the problem gets the best of him. My advice is to reign back and focus that excitement. There are times that his excitement is great in context, but the self-awareness for those times and places is not fully-developed. When Jean learns how to convert all of his positive energy towards the group, his skills will know no bounds.


### Mind on The Ball (self-directed project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/football_machine_learning)

The goal of the project was to build a neural net to analysis previous football performance and predict future performance. I chose to pair with Brian Heim on this project, and his experience with statistics and football was invaluable.  Additonally, we wanted to make a resource that Armstrong could reference back to. As Armstrong members we noticed the quick turn-over at Turing stopped us from digging into really hard topics, and we thought our website could somewhat counteract that.

**1. Completion**

* **4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.**

**2. Organization**

* **3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.**

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* **4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).**

**2. Code Quality**

* **3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* **3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.**

**2. Performance**

* **3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.**

#### From Brian:
This was my first time working with Jean and it was one of the best, if not the best project experiences I have had at Turing. We built a neural net from scratch in two weeks, which is a very difficult task. However, through productive pairing and a lot of math, we came out very successfully. Jean is, in my opinion, the strongest programmer in our cohort. Not only does he have very solid hard skills and a thorough understanding of Ruby, Rails and Object Oriented techniques, he has incredible git workflow and a demeanor that is pleasant to work with. Jean would consistently seek collaboration before implementing a feature. He would regularly ask things like “What do you think about this?”, and “Would you say that this is a valid approach?” before moving forward. He is a hard worker and was dedicated to the project. The only constructive advice that I could think of for Jean is to be careful about taking on too many responsibilities at once. Jean volunteered to give a speech at a Meetup during the final week of the Mod, which he fully disclosed to me early on, and we planned and accounted for. This did not impact the project in any negative way, but I could tell that it was an added stressor during a very stressful week to begin with. Overall, I truly enjoyed working with Jean, and look forward to working with him again.

## D: Professional Skills

### Personal Project pitch
### Mind on The Ball

#### Pitch

Mind on The Ball is an application that presents predictions based on historical data and provides an educational resource for learning about Neural Nets through NFL football statistics.

#### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

1. Learning about Neural Nets is hard and without context, can be overwhelming (Normalizing data, constructing network, calculations).
2. Football data UIs are a little outdated (all HTML)
3. Good Football APIs are expensive and hard to come by

#### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

1. Blog posts documenting process will explain many of these issues, and potentially serve as a resource for Armstron Posse.
2. Will utilize JavaScript/AJAX to speed up requests and limit need to refresh, improving UI
3. Football Stats will be free to use and transparent with an API being provided.

#### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

1. Students wishing to gain knowledge about machine learning, specifically Neural Nets.
2. Football fans who want lightweight statistics on their favorite players with predictions for future performance.

#### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
 * NFL Fantasy API
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
 * Github

### Gear Up

#### [Vote Your Conscience](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
  * I thought this was a very interesting session. I love history and am continually disappointed with my fellow citizen's understanding of what is expected of them in our political culture. I'm not sure how much difference this made to other students, but I was pleased to hear us talking about what citizens must do in a healthy democracy. P.S. - the electoral process is too depressing to think about right now.

#### [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown](Resilience)
  * This was an excellent session. One of the articles described kids who were "at-risk" yet succeeded due to them realizing they were their own "locus of control". This describes my life from 3rd-7th grade very well. It was enlightening to hear someone put more academic terms around my own life. It also helped me realize that the least successful points in my life were ones where I let my resilience slip.

#### [Introversion](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
  * This session was very interesting for me. While I can be outspoken, I identify as a introvert. At the end of the day, I find it draining to be around groups of people and most rewarding to be around 0-3 people. I enjoyed sharing this experience and hearing it echoed by my cohort-mates. I would love to see more gear up sessions where we focused on our cohort. I loved the loved getting to know those I spend the most time with better.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://slack-files.com/T029P2S9M-F31HPPUPN-1099a6777e)

This was an interesting excersize. By forcing me to consider what I value in a number of areas it helped me envision what sorts of jobs I would be happiest at. I plan to come back to this to anchor me in the job search

#### Job Search Strategy

* No gist for workshop

* Saturday
  * Update resume
* Sunday
  * Update Linkdin
* Monday
  * Edit resume
* Daily
  * spend 15-30 min. each day identifying people to reach out
  * make sure I am in contact with mentors/support network
* Weekly
  * Reach out to people I have identified and follow up with previous contacts
* Monthly
  * Work on growing my technical skill in some direction. Examples - dotNet/c#, haskell, dev ops

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Ryan:
You did an awesome job getting us deployed to production, including learning about the asset pipeline. You could work on how you cope with your frustration, as it can be difficult when you get frustrated at each roadblock. That said, you overcome the roadblocks fine.

#### To Susi:
You did a great job advocating for your needs in the group and keeping us update as to where you were at. You could have told us earlier near the start of the project, but once you told us the communication was awesome.

#### To Brendan:
You did a great job contributing well factored semantic code. I know you are an introvert and that is good. When you speak it carries more weight because of it. However, there were a few times when we were doing remote work where I didn't know what the status of your work was. It would have been nice if you had given an update, even if it was just saying you were still working.

#### To Brian:
You are an awesome person to work with. Your cool, level-headed attitude helped us stay on track through a very challenging project. Your math skills on stronger than it seems like you believe they are. I would encourage you to have faith in them, you did an excellent job handling some gnarly multi-variable calc. I am hugely appreciative of you being willing to wrap things up Wednesday and allowing me to speak at Boulder Ruby.


### Being a Community Member

#### From Anna Dolan:
This module I got to know Jean through joining the Armstrong posse and attending posse meetings and spikes. Jean is an excellent teacher, and worked very hard to present difficult concepts to a group of people with mixed experience. I really enjoyed being in Armstrong this module, and I hope to continue to work with & learn from Jean next module as well

### Playing a Part

I feel I greatly contributed to the Turing community through leading Armstrong. Members of the posse were exposed to regression analysis, Python, artifical neurons and neural nets. Additionally, the Python mob programming spike exposed students to an interesting and fun group programming technique. I also spoke at Boulder Ruby and was very well received. I believe this betters the Turing community as it grows our reputation for technical excellence
