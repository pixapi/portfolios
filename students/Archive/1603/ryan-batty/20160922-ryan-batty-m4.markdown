# Ryan Batty - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Three down, one to go.

Going into Mod 4, I knew that I had three major priorities, job search, JavaScript, and graduation. Initially, I felt the last two would fall into place, but it ultimately ended up being a pretty difficult balance to strike.

That said, I do feel that module 4 was a success. With GameTime, my partner and I were able to make an amazingly fun and well written game. With Scale Up, I was able to really push my comfort zone and what I'm capable of. Finally, with Denver Startup Week I had a fantastic collection of events to help with my job search.

Going forward, I would love to say its done and over. My experience at Turing though has taught me that learning is a constant effort, and I feel so far from finished. While my responsibilities at Turing feel finished, I still have a job to nail down and so many new technologies I want to explore. I believe that it is possible though, and I have Turing to thank for that.

IdeaBox is a project that uses jQuery and AJAX to present a list of Ideas that can then be upvoted, downvoted, added, modified, and deleted - all in real time.

**Evaluator: Nate**
* Recommended taking another look at RESTful routes on API's, endpoints were inappropriately based around methods
* Felt the JS was appropriately broken apart

#### Scale Up - Swift + Vapor

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Riizu/race_condition)
* [Blog Post - Welcome to the Bleeding Edge: Web Development in Swift](https://medium.com/@riizu/welcome-to-the-bleeding-edge-web-development-in-swift-129c9a4f9dcd)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

For Scale Up, I decided to do a research spike into Vapor, I brand new web framework written in Swift. Initially my deliverable was intended to be a basic CRUD app, but I quickly discovered the challenge of working with such a new framework (the official 1.0 release only came out last week) and the effects it had on productivity, efficiency, and tooling.

Overall, the project instead became an experiment in dealing with the above challenges and working with an open source group. I spent a lot of time learning and discussing the growth of Vapor in their Slack, exploring various new tooling (Firebase, Auth0), and rolling with the punches in terms of deprecated code and changed framework behavior.

**Evaluator: Meeka**

Code:

Your README still has a lot of the boilerplate stuff in it - so other than the app description there isn’t much in there about what your app specifically does. At minimum I would recommend removing the link to the Vapor example repo and putting in a link to your blog

All code was supposed to be pull requested in to the project - and in addition, any pull request with 18 files would be too difficult for a review to dive into. Especially given the fact that you were working on the bleeding edge of tech, it’s super important to break pull requests up. At minimum, I would expect the font files and bootstrap to be pull requested in separately from the routing. (Something to keep in mind for future projects!)

Blog Post:

Awesome opening section - got me interested in reading right off the bat.

You may want to link to the home pages of some of the languages that you mention. For a completely new developer, they may not know how to google their way into finding ‘swift’ which is something we take for granted after Turing :D

'The Slack channel is constantly active’ - link to the slack channel

Really lovely summary of your trials - gives great context, paints the community and the software in a positive and realistic light. Really good blog post and one I would point folks towards happily!

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riizu/sloc)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* Group Members: Ryan Batty, Parker Pillips

Seven Levels of Code is a programming-themed browser game built using the HTML 5 canvas, JavaScript (written in ES6), and procedural generation.

The player is presented with a procedurally generated dungeon that they must escape by clearing the floor of 'bugs' - places where the dungeon misbehaves, causing strange behavior. When all have been cleared, the last remaining bug will take the player to the next level.

Once all bugs have been cleared on the seventh floor the player has finished their goal. They are then presented with the option to play again, or continue delving deeper into even more difficult levels.

**Evaluator: Meeka**

* Felt proper decision was made in regards to prioritizing a finished product over additional unit tests
* JavaScript well implemented
* Recommended looking into better practices for timeboxing and preventing spending time on features outside of skill level

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I found the movie for this Gear Up quite insightful. The movie maintained a sense of objectiveness on the issue, and directly addressed that it is something that requires support and attention from all sides, not just from a side thats viewed as responsible. I also enjoyed the discussion on how to bring these concerns into Turing as possible action items to improve our own gender diversity, though I did feel at times it was a tad one-sided.

#### There is an "I" in "Team"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I unfortunately missed this Gear Up due to an informational interview that I had with ThinkTank, a local company in the Denver DTC. I did look over the lesson plan though and I was surprised to find just how relateable it was to projects at Turing. Too often its possible to have a group member's opinion overlooked or discounted. Seeing a discussion was made just for this was very gratifying, and I will definitely take some of the points from the included video and discussion topics forward.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

My favorite part of this GitHub was the Fluent talk from Kathy Sierra. I was surprised to see how often I was making my learning experience more difficult. Prior to the video I would of said something like, "Well, you should only use an IDE/some 'calculator-style' tool if you're really good at what it does for you. But I had discounted the amount of extra brain power that takes, and I could immediately quanitate that when I thought of all of the small typos, missed object declarations, or something similar that would of been pointed out by a more robust tool like an IDE. I really enjoyed this Gear Up.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Telling Your Story, using the completed Flower Exercise
* [Turing.io Profile](https://www.turing.io/alumni/ryan-batty)

**LinkedIn / Resume Summary**
I'm a developer driven by a passion for delivering engaging and interesting digital experiences. Whether its a traditional full stack web application, a mobile solution,  or something new, I am happy to tackle any challenge and learn new technologies whenever possible. With prior experience in Information Technology and Customer Service I am not afraid to get my hands dirty, fixing and fine-tuning a variety of platforms, tackling customer issues head on, and working as part of a bigger picture to deliver the absolute best experience possible to the client.

**Takeaway**
Utilizing the flower diagram and advice from Lia, I was able to create a compelling portfolio and resume highlighting my strengths and job goals.

#### Telling Your Story, using the completed Flower Exercise
* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/negotiations.md)

**Takeaway**

To be honest, I had initially not enjoyed the concept of this workshop. The flower exercise seemed to be excessively verbose and time consuming, especially considering that we first heard of it while wrapping up our personal projects at the end of Mod 3.

That said I actually found it surprisingly insightful. I did not follow the full worksheet process, but I did use it to guide my thoughts, whenever I felt I didn't know where to start, or had too many thoughts on a topic. I especially liked the section on quantifying how to pick a target job location. Being willing to be so flexible in job location had made it difficult to consider how to rank potential offers, but this exercise gave me very easy to follow topic points to assess my aptitude for a location.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Parker Phillips**

This module, you and I finally had the opportunity to officially work together from day one on a project. I say finally because its no secret that we wanted to do so much sooner, but unfortunately the all mighty shuffle.pop was not on our side.

Being my only group experience in Mod 4, I had nothing to compare this experience with during the module, but I feel safe in saying it was truly wonderful. We spent many hours over many long days, but I think we really meshed in our level of dedication, motivation, and passion. While this could result in the occasional frustration or butting of heads, we always worked through it.

What I was even happier to see though was your growth through the project in two categories. The first was in JavaScript, which you had mentioned during our DTR was a concern for you due to struggles with IdeaBox. Rather than shy away though, you dived head first and often spent additional time outside of our scheduled meetings improving your personal understanding and skills. This had the excellent side benefit of encouraging me, resulting in a cyclical effect of positivity and growth.

The second of these categories is one that I've talked to you a lot about throughout the course of Turing, and thats self-confidence. From the beginning of the program you always were incredibly talented, so it was a struggle watching you beat yourself up over the little things, or think that you weren't capable of something. While this issue still occurred every so often, you always were receptive to constructive criticism, feedback, and even asked for some of both on your own. You made a conscious decision to tackle a hard challenge, and often became the voice of positivity whenever we struggled.

Going forward, I really urge you to take this change in mindset with you to your first job and beyond. I think that the moment you recognize your strengths you will certainly become a developer that other's look to for guidance, strength, and support.

Thank you for such an awesome experience together, and I'm really rooting for you.

### Being a Community Member

**Parker Phillips**

Ryan, you are one of my closest friends and I was super stoked when I learned that we were going to be able to choose our partners for GameTime. We hadn't had the opportunity to partner on a project (except for that weird BlackThursday fiasco) but we had helped each other a couple times in the other modules.

I was not feeling very confident in my JS abilities at the start of the project, but you quickly assuaged those feelings. Whether you instilled me with a false confidence until I learned or exposed skill that was there will forever be a mystery to me, but I thank you for doing so. This was by and large my best group experience at Turing. Obviously part of this is due to the fact that we get along very well, but also your willingness to help and your patience when something doesn't click. There were a couple times when we were both high-stressed that those qualities strained for the both of us, but it always seemed to work out in the end. I think we both could've benefitted from better communication during those times and it's definitely something we both need to keep in mind and work on.

Your confidence level with your coding has been something that I truly admire; and none of it I feel is displaced. You are a wildly talented developer and I don't believe there is a problem someone could give you that you couldn't solve. I feel like this module and the last you really ran with that ability. You always succeeded in the first two modules, but lately you've been going above and beyond. From writing your personal project in react native, to developing a swift app, and somehow convince me to dive into a randomly generated roguelike after a week of JS. That drive, passion, and talent should take you as far as you want to go.

### Playing a Part

This module it was difficult to organize explicit activities within the Turing community at large. The two largest sources of this were the seperation between our cohort and the rest of the backend physically, and the sheer balance of responsibilites - especially with job search.

Early on I spent a period of time still running the Miyamoto Posse, but as my job search and workload ramped up, I felt I was not able to dedicate the time necessary that the posse deserved. Thankfully I had picked a new leader last module, Ryan Workman, and he stepped in with zero fuss, really doing a fantastic job. I feel pleased that I was able to build an interest in game development in him as well as truly fortunate that such an amazing replacement stepped in to fill my shoes.

I also managed a recreational group after school on Fridays/Saturdays that played the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. This was quite successful, with about ten unique participants. Many mentioned less stress over the typical Turing woes, so I was glad I could support their growth and mental health in some fashion.

Regardless, I do wish I could of done more. I think as a cohort we had wanted to endeavor to not do the stereotypical Module 4 thing and retreat into ourselves during the module. Some success was achieved, but there is definitely room to improve.
