# David Tinianow - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for this module was to get a firm grasp of JavaScript.  I wanted to get comfortable enough with JavaScript to feel confident taking code challenges in it and applying for jobs that use it.  My secondary goal for this module was to get my portfolio ready to start job hunting.  I wanted to get myself ready to hit the ground running job hunting once Turing is over.

* 1: Developer fails to complete iterations 1 through 4, or there are significant issues with delivered functionality.

##### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby demonstrating a broad/deep understanding of available language features. Application demonstrates great understanding of Object-Oriented modeling. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* __3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 2: Developer is able to accomplish tasks with Ruby code, but lacks attention to broader design and organizational concepts. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but code is sloppy, disorganized, or poorly factored.

##### 3. Rails Style & API

* __4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

##### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

* __4: Developer uses elegant and idiomatic Javascript to accomplish common tasks. Demonstrates solid understanding of function passing and manipulation. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* 2: Developer can accomplish basic tasks with Javascript but implementation is largely copy/pasted or non-idiomatic. Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dtinianow/head_first_java)

* [Submission Form 2](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/scale-up-week-5/david-tinianow.markdown)

For Scale Up, I decided to learn Java.  I was interested in learning Java to compare the differences between Ruby and another object-oriented programming language, as well as to learn a coding language that deals with memory management.  I worked through the Head First Java book for Scale Up, and plan to continue learning Java after graduating Turing.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

We had an interesting discussion talking about what qualities political leaders seem to lack. In our country, there seems to be too much interest in power, money, and ego, rather than genuine belief in a particular cause.  The mark of a true leader seems to be somehow who believes in a cause greater than themselves, and is willing to do whatever it takes to support that cause.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I missed this Gear Up due to a time-sensitive code challenge. I have read the book Quiet by Susan Cain though. As an introvert, I think it is important to be self-aware of my natural preferences, use that knowledge to help place myself in optimal environments, but also make sure not to use introversion or being outside of my comfort zone as an excuse.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

We had a great discussion about what it means to truly be resilient.  We also discussed the importance of self-awareness in cultivating resilience.  We also realized it is virtually impossible to get through Turing without resilience.  In response to the article, we decided that thinking positive thoughts may create a temporary feeling of resilience, but acceptance is a long-term solution and more effective way to build it.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/dtinianow/4383c35957a09162378a1f575de75e13)

My top three priorities for a job are to have the ability to travel, good mentorship and healthy work environment, and to work for a place that provides challenging and meaningful work.  Travel is important because I want to have the opportunity to live in and see many different places while I am young.  Good mentorship is important because this is the foundation for my career.  Meaningful and challenging work is important because I was become stagnant and frustrated if I feel like the work I am doing is arbitrary and petty.

#### Blogging

* [Objects Everywhere: Java vs Ruby (Part 1)](https://medium.com/@dtinianow/objects-everywhere-java-vs-ruby-part-1-171f4d6a88db#.wkaa11753)

This blog post was written as part of the Scale Up project.  I wanted to learn more about the differences between Ruby and Java as OOP languages.  I spent a lot of time researching these differences and wrote a pretty thorough blog post giving highlighting specific examples of differences in each language.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Matt Campbell: I’m glad we finally got a chance to work together on Gametime.  Your enthusiasm and creativity were infectious and made it a lot of fun to work on this project.  I was especially impressed by how much you accomplished at the zero hour, plowing ahead on testing and adding AI.  I also appreciated that you made yourself available to work remotely even when you were not able to come in.  My only constructive feedback would be to slow down at times and explain your thought process a bit more before diving in.  You have great logical reasoning, so I think stepping back and planning your attack could help you arrive at a solution more efficiently and help avoid rabbit holes.  Overall you were a great partner and I had a blast working with you.  

### Being a Community Member

David, pairing with you was a great experience.  We haven’t really gotten to work together much since the beginning of module one when we would stay late to do drills so it was fun to see how far we’ve come, but also be in a similar situation just starting out with JavaScript.  I really appreciated that you kept pushing us to refactor because our code ended up being pretty clean and I am proud of it.  I think that you were definitely the engine that kept us going despite the burn out that we were both experiencing.  I also learned a lot about vanilla JavaScript from you since you seemingly had a much better grasp on it than I did, especially early on.  I’m not sure I would’ve ever gotten some of the features to work - like the ball collisions - without your help. I can’t wait until we put those web sockets in so we can play each other while you’re in Austin.  Thanks for the great project and being a great pair!
