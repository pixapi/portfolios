## B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Caleb9193/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

For this project, we'll be increasingly thinking about the "server" and "client"
as separate entities. We'll be using:

* A Rails application to manage data related to our ideas and serve
  initial UI templates (or just `public/index.html`)
* JavaScript (with jQuery) to manage client-side interactions and communicate
  asynchronously with the server

In order to get more experience doing DOM manipulations and AJAX event handling on our own,
we will _not_ be using client-side frameworks (Ember, Angular, React, etc.).

Your entire application will consist of one HTML page or template. You will not have separate pages for each CRUD action.

All of your AJAX functionality will be triggered by jQuery.


### Specification Adherence

* **10 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### User Interface

* **3 points** - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.


### Testing

* **0 points** - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **9 points** - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
### JavaScript Style

* **8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* **10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Caleb9193/gametime)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

- Points: (base 150)

### Playability Features

We want your game to be full-featured and playable -- not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

- Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
- Allow the user to start a new game
- Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
- Score Tracking: How this works will vary by game, but at the end of the game, generate a score for the winning player
- Scoreboard -- track scores across multiple game sessions. Since we aren't incorporating a server for our games, client-side storage like a cookie or LocalStorage will suffice.
- Create multiple rounds of difficulty. (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc)

### Features

* 35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* __24 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs__
* 10 points - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 0 points - Application crashes during normal usage

### User Interface

* __15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.__
* 10 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 5 points - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 0 points - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Testing

* 30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
* __20 points - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.__
* 10 points - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 0 points - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style

* 30 points - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* __25 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__
* 15 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.
* 5 points - Your client-side application does not function. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
* 0 points - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### Workflow

* __25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.__
* 15 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 10 points - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 5 points - The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.

* __15 points - Zero complaints__
* 10 points - Five or fewer complaints
* 5 points - Six to ten complaints
* 0 points - More than ten complaints

total = 124

### Gear Up
#### Introversion and Extroversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

My group had a long discussion about whether labelling people as introverts or extroverts did more harm than good. We also discussed how people can fall all along that spectrum.


#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

My group's discussion was based mostly around how poorly this election has been run and the seeming bias of all the resources we could find. We decided it all comes down to each individual doing their own extensive research on each candidate and drawing their conclusion after viewing each side.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I was made to realize how my own hardships have shaped me, and how important it is to view each challenge and hardship as a chance to do better and be better.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Overcoming Job Searching Imposter's Syndrome

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

Priorities:

* Mentoring

* Room for Growth

* Chance to learn new technologies

Barriers:

* Not confident reaching out and making a connections

* Don't know how to approach the topic of getting hired

Action Steps:

* Attend more meetups-start in a more relaxed environment

* Try to get to know people who can intro me into the job talk-get a wingman

#### Negotiations

[Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/negotiations.md)

I thought this class was very useful. Some thing I learned were:

* Never negotiate over email

* Never make the first offer

* Never accept an offer on the spot

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I haven't given much written feedback this module, though I have given a lot of verbal feedback

### Being a Community Member

From Nick Chambers:

Caleb and I worked together this past module in the Pahlka Posse. He was one of the main motivators during our project work time and brought a lot of enthusiasm for the technical side of our project. I always enjoyed hearing his insight into both programming and other things, and he has a passion for coding that is contagious. I'm bummed he won't be working with us after graduation, but I hope he'll come hang out when he gets the chance.

From Noah Berman:

It was great working with Caleb on Pahlka Posse's project this mod. He lead the 'narrative' team through a number of tricky challenges - structuring a complicated backend system and working to get a central "game map" established. His flexibility and willingess to jump with us into challenges meant we were able to accomplish a lot in the relatively short time available to us. Despite claiming to be solidly backend he was able to steer us through a front-end heavy project. All of the above will serve him well out "in the world." Thanks for your leadership Caleb and be sure to stay in touch with us at Pahlka!

From Phyllis Hugunien:

Caleb Cowen joined the Turing Pair Channel soon after its inception and was an active member always willing to pair when I put out a request.  For a time used this exclusively and learned so much from Caleb’s patient manner of breaking down principles and helping you decipher basic concepts.  He is kind, humble and empathetic to student’s needs.  

Caleb has a vast storehouse of knowledge of Ruby principles and is a superb teacher who utilizes the Socratic method to guide one in their quest for the solution.  Even while working on his own projects he would take time out to answer a question or help you get past a block.  He is a huge reason why the Pair channel became a success and another resource for Turing students.  I am so grateful for all the assistance he provided especially in the early days.
