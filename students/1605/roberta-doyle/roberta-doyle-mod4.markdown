## Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
* I had a very productive discussion with my group reflecting on how unprepared people end up taking leadership roles. It was interesting to reflect how common it is for people to get promoted to a leadership role because of a job they did in the past, which does not necessarily mean that they have the skills to be a good leader.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
* Being aware of the different needs, strengths and weakness of introverts and extroverts.

#### Resilience
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
* I missed this session because I had to go to the Brazilian consulate.


### Top 3 priorities in the job search
* Connecting with people in the industry
* Making list of companies and taking the time to research and write cover letters
* Applying for jobs

I've also have taken the time to clean up my GitHub and work on resume and LinkedIn profile.
I've been working on technical challenges to get more practice and feel more prepared during interviews.

### Feedback

From Pat:
I enjoyed working with you on GameTime and Scale-Up. You’re very good at communicating what you’re thinking and making sure that the spec/project requirements are always being met. I really enjoyed watching you pick React and Redux so quickly, and I especially appreciated your willingness to reach out for help when you felt stuck. I’m confident that you’ll make an immediate impact on any team you end up working on next, and I wouldn’t hesitate to work with you again in the future.

To Pat:
I enjoyed working with you during this module. You have a strong knowledge of JavaScript, React and Redux. I definitely learned a lot from pairing with you. You’re committed to the projects you work on and with the quality of the code you write. My only suggestion would be to communicate a little bit more, a few times I felt I had to ask how you were feeling about the project or follow up with you. 
I’m excited to see what you’ll do next!

### Playing a Part
