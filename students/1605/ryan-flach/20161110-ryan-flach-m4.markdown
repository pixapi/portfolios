# Ryan Flach - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal coming into module 4 was to develop a greater understanding and level of preparedness for entering the workforce. To better achieve this goal, I aimed to differentiate myself from my fellow students by branching out into a language that is not explored within the curriculum, in addition to learning JavaScript. Due to the time of year in which I would be graduating, I also aimed to have at least one offer by graduation. Or, if unable to achieve an offer, to have been in the stages of the interview process with at least one company.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

**Description**

A single-page CRUD application with a Rails back-end API and a JS/jQuery/AJAX front-end.

**Evaluation Comments**

1. Could have a runner file to separate your document.ready into another file
2. Truncated edits will only contain the truncated text and not the full text (truncation should be for display only)
3. Overall, nice work with main functionality.
4. Would be nice to give feedback to user when validation of a field fails
5. Enter on existing ideas when editing should not trigger a new line (broken feature that previously worked)
6. Search title is hard to see
7. Overall composition is good, but definite room for improvement
8. Can send params in request specs by passing them as a second argument as a hash
9. Nice work on testing - could go a little heavier on edge cases
10. Could be nice to break JS into separate files to compartmentalize
11. Chained if/else if can look nicer as single-line if statements if there are only two options

**Evaluation Scores**

**Total Points Earned: 144/150**

_Specification Adherence_<br />
**10 points** - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of format.js in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

_User Interface_<br />
**5 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

_Testing_<br />
**8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

_Ruby and Rails Quality_<br />
**10 points** - Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

_JavaScript Style_<br />
**8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

_Workflow_<br />
**10 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/text_talk)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/week-4-kickoff.markdown)

**Description**

My iteration of Scale Up was a two-week deep-dive into Elixir and functional programming. After reading a lot of documentation and following through tutorials, I produced two blogs ([Following Passion in Programming](https://medium.com/@ryanflach/following-passion-in-programming-ff7e5256ce86#.nxfppljbu), [Fun Things in Elixir](https://medium.com/@ryanflach/fun-things-in-elixir-723f71c4b4a2#.j7bewync5)) and a simple CLI that turned user-provided text into speech (see GitHub URL link above).

**Evaluation Scores**

**Total Points Earned: 310/300**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Jeepney Jump

* [GitHub URL](https://www.github.com/ryanflach/jeepney_jump)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

**Description**

Jeepney Jump is a Filipino-themed 2D endless obstacle game. Built in JavaScript, it is a single-page, client-side web application that utilizes Webpack.

As the player, you control a jeepney, an iconic form of public transit in the Philippines.

**Evaluation Comments**

1. Mixing ES5 and ES6 syntax inside of the same file is not a best practice
2. Definite opportunities for refactoring, particularly in game.js
3. Good number of tests, even if they are all unit tests
4. Opportunities for additional clarity in wording of some tests
5. Would have liked to have seen class inheritance to avoid classes with very similar states (object, bonus, background_object, etc.)

**Evaluation Scores**

**Total Points Earned: 135/150**

_Functional Expectations_

**30 points**: Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs and exceeds some expectations set by instructors

_User Interface_

**15 points**: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

_Testing_

**25 points**: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

_JavaScript Style_

**Feedback to Me**
* "Thanks for being a badass and picking up aalllllll of my slack!" - Angela Lindow

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
* The article regarding the balance between rights and responsibilities left a strong impression in its argument that each right is balanced by an accompanying responsibility (e.g., the right to a fair trial and the responsibility to serve on a jury). I think this is often forgotten, with rights being taken for granted without the thought of responsibilities that may be required to uphold those rights by the nation. In my personal view, until money is largely eliminated from politics, it will be difficult to elect true change, due to the nature of necessary fundraising to gain re-election. An excellent book on this topic is 'Republic Lost,' by Lawrence Lessig.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
* This was an interesting session for me. People have sometimes assumed me to be an introvert--a label I have not necessarily wanted--and I suspect that it may be at least partially true. I do enjoy quiet and time alone, but I also very much enjoy social activities with friends. The video helped to highlight that a label is not definitive, and that there are those that exist more in the middle: ambiverts. Maybe I'm an ambivert?

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
* I enjoyed this session. As mentioned in the articles, resilience has become a buzz-topic, and although seemingly well-understood within academia, there are still a number of leadership courses that attempt to teach it for a high fee. I liked that one researcher found that every individual, regardless of their resilience, had a breaking point, and that your level of resilience can vary over time. Like many topics within the realm of Psychology, the bottom line on who has resilience is, 'it depends.'


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Overcoming Job-Hunting Imposter's Syndrome

* No workshop URL
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/ryanflach/504bba027329783642d566349e5c9858)

You can easily be your own worst enemy in the job hunt. Allow others the opportunity to decide whether or not you are right for a position, rather than preemptively making a negative decision on their behalf that can limit your potential. Be cognizant of the barriers you are imposing upon yourself.

#### Negotiating

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/negotiations.md)
* No deliverables for this session

I got a lot of good tips from this session:
* When asked for your desired salary range, you can instead say that you'd like more context on the position (you want them to give a number first - 'I'd love to hear what you're offering for the position so I have a little more context'). * When you receive an offer, always take time to think about it. Things to look into: salary (initial plus small annual bump), vacation (if unlimited, what is their minimum number of days to take off per year [or the average]).
* Don't negotiate for less than $5,000 more per year - typically ask for 10% more and expect 5%. 'Thank you so much for this opportunity - I was hoping to be closer to $X, and X benefit'. If no room to budge on budget, negotiate for mentorship time, try for signing bonus.
* Putting another company on the table can be considered aggressive. Best to phrase it as 'considering all options on the table, ...' You can say that you have another offer if asked directly, but do not mention any specifics.
* Try and do negotiations in person or over the phone.
* Regarding online applications, always first try and reach out to someone at the company to find out what the best approach is.

#### Blog Writing and Peer Review

* [Workshop URL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BtFtpS_OWhQp9AJbXc9woI5ql8sD-etxwnFc-4rixEI/edit#slide=id.p)
* Deliverable was Scale Up Blog Posts:
  * [Following Passion in Programming](https://medium.com/@ryanflach/following-passion-in-programming-ff7e5256ce86#.nxfppljbu)
  * [Fun Things in Elixir](https://medium.com/@ryanflach/fun-things-in-elixir-723f71c4b4a2#.j7bewync5)

Blog posts, even if technical, should be written in a way in which they can appeal to or be followed by a non-technical audience. Primary templates include story, opinion, how-to, how something works, and review.

#### Top 3 Job Search Priorities
1. Research or reach out to an employee of a company each day
2. Continue to attend meetups
3. Continue to network and post blogs, remain active


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* "Angela was a positive and responsive team member, despite significant life circumstances that limited her involvement initially, subsequently prohibiting it altogether. In the time we were able to work together, Angela's professionalism and proficiency within her skill set was complemented by consistent and clear communication. It was a pleasure being able to work with Angela one final time." - Feedback provided to Angela Lindow
* "Pat proved himself early in module 3 to have both a keen interest and proficiency in JavaScript. Throughout this module, he has gone above and beyond to answer not only my own questions, but also to provide learning guides to the rest of our class. I've always found him to be an excellent classmate and communicator, and I look forward to seeing what comes next for him." - Feedback provided to Pat Wentz

### Being a Community Member

* Please see feedback from GameTime above.
* "Ryan didn't even think twice when he sat down next to me to look at my project. I had hit a huge hurdle and just wasn't sure how to reach the end goal that I had defined. Ryan immediately asked what the goal was, what steps I had already taken to reach it, and if I had any tests written. He never once touched the keyboard without asking me first. He encouraged me to think outloud for all of my processing and asked questions to help me find the answers. Ryan made me feel comfortable, confident, and at ease. We worked together to come to a solution. He made sure that I understood every step of our process. Ryan was amazing to pair with and I am sad that he is graduating, but extremely excited to see what he does next!" - Feedback received from Susi Irwin
* "Ryan was clearly one of the brightest and most helpful students not just in this module, but throughout our entire Turing time.  No one was more ready to help answer questions after hours on Slack than Ryan.  If I was ever stuck on something for longer than an hour or two, he was the first person I would head to for help because I knew he would always be ready and willing to lend a hand.  Ryan always provides great insight in activities such as gear-up or our professional development sessions and I am a better student and person because of it." - Feedback received from Matt Campbell

### Playing a Part

* I volunteered at RailsBridge the weekend of Nov. 4-5.
* I volunteered at Rocky Mountain Ruby
* I paired with students in lower modules and regularly assisted my peers.
