# Yoseph Anderon - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal this module was to have a deeper dive into Javascript and be on my way to get a job. Mainly because I have been exploring Javascript since Module 1 and have already made a few projects before Module 4.

### End of Module Assessment

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* **3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5, and one supporting feature, with few bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* **3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Rails Style & API

* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 5. Testing

* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 6. User Interface

* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 7. Workflow

* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

Instructor Evaluation Points

Specification Adherence

10 points: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of format.js in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
User Interface

5 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
Testing

9 points - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
Ruby and Rails Quality

10 points - Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.
JavaScript Style

8 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

9 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Score

### Features

* 35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* __25 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs__
* 10 points - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 0 points - Application crashes during normal usage

### User Interface

* 15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
* __10 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.__
* 5 points - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 0 points - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Testing

* 30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.
* 25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* __20 points - use of stubs is good for trying to test features - no collision detection tests which brings this score down a little__
* 10 points - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 0 points - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style

* 30 points - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## Feedback

Zack Forbing

> Yoseph -
on gametime, you were a champ. I really appreciated you letting me puzzle things out for myself sometimes, but not letting it get too far down the rabbit hole. your javascript ability is exceptional, but I would have liked to see you put more passion into it. I was, however, thankful that you expressed your feelings about wanting to focus on the job hunt. I can't really blame you for that. You've been studying JS since mod 1, so I know that the project was a different experience for you than it was for me. I was really appreciative of you pushing for us to build it out in ES6, it has helped my understanding of the differences between ES5 and ES6, although it was a source of frustration at the time. I know if we had had more time we could have figured out all the particulars of our game instead of just the MVP. Thanks for a great project!

## Professional Skills

### Gear Up Reflections

#### Introverts and Extroverts

This GearUp was about the differences between extroverts and introverts. I agreed that those labels are what many people relate to, but that it's also ultimately up to that person on how they react. When people cling to those words, they begin to conform to one of those categories. Everyone has their own benefits as to what they can be.

#### Resilience

Resilience is a determination to never stay down once someone is hit down. It resonated with me because I consider it a trait that I enjoy having. The one problem though was that it seemed as if there was a confusion between resilience and determination. The idea that going through a problem when it hits someone down, is resilience. Without the power to stand up after being knocked down, many people would not have gotten to where they ended up.

### Description of your top 3 priorities in the job search and why

My three priorities are:

* Time to get job
* Salary
* Location

My priorities that I would like after reaching a stable point:

* Flexible time off
* Mentoring
* Salary

### Action plan for how to overcome perceived barriers to the job search

I plan on going out and being productive going to Meet-ups and networking.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I really enjoyed the whole Turing community and everything that they have offered. They have always been supportive since the very first day, and even though there have been stumbling block, I still believe in Turing's missions. I am happy with how the community have been to me and was glad to always contribute as much as I could.

### Being a Community Member

Alisher Sadikov

> Yoseph has been supporting me a lot and this module is no exception. He has a great calm way of explaining concepts and leading to the solution. I would find him in the basement and ask some questions about my projects and he would take his time to explain things. Even over the weekends, he was available on slack/phone to help me out. In addition, I have seen him a lot offering help to module 1 students. All in all, I think Yoseph is a valuable member of Turing community!

Eric Wahlgren-Sauro

> Yoseph took an interest in me since the day I stepped into Turing. He was always willing to help me out with a difficult problem on any of the assigned projects. During my first time through module one, we paired and he helped me gain a better understanding around the structure of Headcount. He was someone I felt I could always chat with casually as well. At Turing I often find myself living in a survival mindset and having him around helped to put me a bit more at ease.

### Playing a Part

* Always looking for people to help if they look stuck
* Emotional support when working on big projects
* Help students when they message me on slack
