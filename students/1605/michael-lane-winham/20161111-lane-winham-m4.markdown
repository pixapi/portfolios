# Michael Lane Winham - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

* I set out this module to transition from working with something we have worked with for a long duration of time to learning something new and to enjoy the uncomfortable steps along the way. I wanted to embrace what it feels like to start at the beginning but know that it is not as bad as it seems because I have skills that I can relate to new topics. In addition to learning new information, I would like to continue to grow on what I have learned.

* This project was designed to teach us how to manipulate an HTML canvas in addition to getting a great deal of exposure and familiarity with JavaScript.

##### Evaluation Scores:

#### Features

* **27 points** - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

#### User Interface

* **15 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

* **20 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### JavaScript Style

* **20 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* **25 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

#### Scale Up

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/looking_for_project.markdown)

##### Description:

* This project was designed to mimic what it will be like to work on an open source code base in a language or framework unknown to you.

##### Evaluator Comments:

* overall I think you were a great voice on the lookingFor team and contributed to the project
* I'd like to see more critical and suggestive PR reviews. That is why both scores are only a 3. I would have considered full points for more reviews or more detailed reviews. If you look at the language of the score template - I think you could have been more "useful". You have great thoughts and ideas - bring that to PRs.
* Blog post review score pending the review information
* Great work this module.

## Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience
[markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I thought this was a great session. It gave everyone time to read information the would either build on or create thoughts for them to talk about. I think reminding everyone that it is not only a privilege but a right that you should exercise is a great thing.

#### Introversion/Extroversion on Teams
[markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I thought this was a powerful session. I am very familiar with working in teams and by myself. That alone can cause issues or work very well. I have not however looked at how teams or organizations accommodate or even account for personality traits like the ones covered. It really gave me a new way to look at situations and how others act.

#### Resilience
[markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I thoroughly enjoyed this session. I feel that this is a session all module one students should experience. I say this because resilience seems very straight forward but I think that it encompasses so much more and can commonly get shrugged off. It is always a necessary trait or mindset to exercise.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Exercise Follow Up
[lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

Important to me for my job search:

* Environment I will be working within

* People I will be working with

* Clear understanding of my role and what is expected of me

Perceived Barriers:

* Potential failure to recall learned skills
    * I will combat this by altering the way I study and  challenge myself after Turing

* Trouble jumping right into networking
    * Ramp up my meet up attendance and make personal goals of how many people I will talk to and have a talking point ready

#### Negotiations

[lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/negotiations.md)

My takeaways:

* Always have the other person put a salary number down first

* If an offer is given, don't give a timeline to get back to them

* Don't give information about companies to anyone else

#### Job Shadowing

My takeaways:
* I would not enjoy working in a start up for my first few positions

* The codebase might be bigger but it is all things we have covered at Turing

* Hiring managers understand the situation I am in and will knowingly hire someone with professional experience.

#### Blog Posts
[lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/writing_a_blog_post_and_peer_review.md)

My takeaways:

* Just like many other forms of writing, there are many ways to write blogs

* Blogs can be used for many purposes

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* To Kris (blog post): That is a good bit of information. I have only a few suggestions but nothing major. First, you present the information in a way that is non-biased which is perfect unless you wanted to portray that you like one technology over the other. In that case I would make it more clear as to which you prefer and why. Also you mention a few concepts that may be unfamiliar to the reader (Dart, data-binding, and TypeScript). It works as is but if you wanted to add a sentence with a brief over view of the concepts I think it would only benefit. Well done!

* To Caleb (blog post): I thought this was a great, light-hearted, and almost comical post about your experience. I think you got your point across easily and related to how others most certainly feel. Knowing what you have done however, I think you could add some depth or even a secondary post talking about your experience getting started with Rust and Python. They may not be in the scope of front-end vs backend but could only expand on ways to tackle new languages and frame works.

* To Matt P. (blog post): I have a few thoughts. First, I liked the outline and thought it was laid out well. I really liked how you included a part on things that you want to cover in the future assuming that scale up will not satisfy what you set out to accomplish. I also agree with you stating that you will include code snippets that your excited about. I think that is always helpful when reading something a bit more technical.

* To Jason (blog post): Thats a great outline and I like how its more oh a how to vs this is what I experienced. One thing I would think about adding in light of the Turing community is having your code reviewed or ask questions to people with more practice but thats just a thought.

### Being a Community Member

* From Tommasina: Hey! Loved your blog post! I am right here with you on the difficulty of React… ask me why my project isn’t done... or actually don’t, lolol. :wink:  Anyways, here’s my feedback:

Quick grammar note: "those whom use it to create a light-weight, compartmentalized" could actually be “who" not “whom". My tip for remembering that is trying to replace it with an object or subject pronoun. Here, that’d be like, “Them use it to create” or “They use it to create”—since “they” sounds right, we could use the subject form, so "who”. (Sorry, former English major here. hehe)

Second note for clarification: "will alter it itself” — perhaps change “it” to “its state” so the point is easier to understand.

Third suggestion: "This was a concept that took me far too long to become even mildly comfortable with.” — I feel ya! How about reframing it for future employers though? What about “I’m glad I finally understand the complexities of state inheritance!” or something to show your learning in a positive light?

Lastly, ‘Javascript’ in your last sentence reminded me of Lia telling us to make sure to spell JavaScript with a capital S in it. And great conclusion recapping what you covered!

From Jason: Lane was a great partner to work with for Game Time. He was extremely easy to work with, and always willing to give me space to experiment with the code. He also has a tenacity about going in a certain direction and finding the most efficient or succinct solution, which really helped us break through some real challenging spots. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with Lane on another project. I always have confidence in his work being done completely, thoroughly, and creatively.

### Playing a Part

* Attending all school days
* Participating in regular retros
* Helping students both in and outside of my cohort solve problems with their code and offer guidance moving forward
* Lead a spike session geared towards working on job hunt material open to all cohorts
