# Drew Palazzari - Module 2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Professionally, I learned how to find and reach out to Developers around the world. I also improved my group working dynamics. I enjoy working within groups and have had only great experiences with them. 

Technically, I learned about Ruby on Rails and got an invaluable understanding of what it means to be a web developer. I can make a semi-decent web application with user authentication/authorization in under an hour, including basic styling. Module 2's teaching style really helped me learn a lot of content in a very effective way. I love using Rspec and reading rails error messages- mostly because I have had a lot of practice, and I rarely see an error message that I do not understand. 

Throughout the mod, I also made adjustments to my personal website, which I enjoyed:

## B: Individual & Group Work

### Group Projects

Group Projects are both challenging and rewarding. I enjoy them far more than individual projects. Two minds are always better than one.

### Lobbify (Little Shop Final Project)

[Website App](http://lobbify.herokuapp.com/)
[Source Code](https://github.com/drod1000/lobbify)

Project Manager: Daniel Rodriguez
Group members: Nick Gheorghita, Daniel Rodriguez, Laszlo Balogh, Drew Palazzari

We decided to make an app where Lobbyists could peruse and purchase outings with United States Senators.

### Blogger

I chose to add Blogger to my portfolio simply because of how useful it was. I learned the most from this tutorial, bar none. It walked the developer through the whole process of building a rails application, and was still around for reference during confusion at other times/different projects. It also went through every error message one might see while working on Rails.


### Bike Share

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/bike-share)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/bike-share)

Bike Share was a sinatra project that utilized ActiveRecord methods to organize and do analytics on massive csv files. All as a web based app.

It was the first group Project of our Cohort. I was grouped with Kyle Heppenstall and Josh Cohen. It went really well!

Overall Sal was impressed and pleased with our project. We fulfilled all expectations, and had excellent testing. Room for improvement in our styling.

###Evaluation Scores
1)Functional Expectations: 3
2)ActiveRecord use: 3.5
3)User Experience and Conventions: 3.5
4)Code Organization/Quality: 4
5)Testing: 4
6) Working Collaboratively: 4

### Individual Projects

#### [Job Tracker](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/job-tracker)

[Heroku Link](https://desolate-river-68572.herokuapp.com/)

I think Job Tracker is a good example of all I've learned this mod (which is a ton). It was hard, but I thoroughly enjoyed using TDD to drive the development. It was hard, but not so hard that I couldn't figure aspects of the markdown out. I think this is a testament to my growth as a developer and learner within the Turing program.

hey @Dpalazzari awesome job on this. i left ya some comments. let me know if you have questions! good work pushing it to heroku too üëç

i encourage you to commit more often!

Rubric

1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations
4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

2) Routes
3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

3) Controllers
3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

4) ActiveRecord
3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

5) Views
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

6) User Experience
4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

7) Testing
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features


## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Responding to Microaggressions

I think Microaggressions are a problem. I also think that some things that some people consider microaggressions, are actually not microaggressions. As a stright, white, male in America it is hard for me to relate to microaggressions. It's sad, but I really just have no experience in the matter. Reading about examples though, I understand why many people hear/experience microaggressions and are hurt by it. I will strive to not accidentally commit microaggressions in the workplace and at Turing.

#### Journey Mapping

I did not get much from this Gear-up, to be honest. It was not for lack of effort though. I think one of the big takeaways I got from this Gear up, is the ability to see what other problems a User might have when visiting a Rails application for the first time. You want your apps to be easy to use, clear, and awesome. Nobody wants their users to have big problems or issues because of lack of clarity or confusion on your app.

#### Grit

This Gear up was about grit. In my opinion, it should have been called passion. There is very little passion involved when it comes to grit. A person with grit persists, and endures through hardship, despit the hardship. 

Either way, it did teach the value in being resiliently passionate about your hobbies. Even when it gets hard at Turing, you cannot give up. I enjoy coding, and I don't want one step-back to get in the way of my achievement of becoming a professional web developer.

### Professional Development Workshops

It's good to be a great professional, and a skilled Developer.

#### Finding Opportunites

We were told to start looking for companies we'd like to work for, and find a contact or someone who works for that company. We must have 10 companies with contacts by December 16th. I have slowly added more companies over the course of the mod.

UPDATE: time to start sending cold outreach emails to those contacts!

#### Intro to Project Management

Biggest takeaway was the difference between agile and waterfall workflows, and why Turing students should pretty much always use an agile workflow. This lecture was really useful in my success in Bike Share. 

In my group projects we always stuck to the agile workflow. This ensured with finished everything thoroughly and finished it off with styling. It turned out pretty well.

In both group projects, We also elected a project manager. They did an excellent job keeping waffle up to date, setting up meetings, and ensuring that everything got completed. I was glad to have a project manager in both cases.

I cannot think of anything that did not got well.

#### Feedback II

Most of the feedback I gave was praise worthy. When I did give constructive feedback, I tried to focus on glaring issues that the recipient may not be aware of. I learned that I work very well with other people, and am good at keeping the atmosphere light-hearted, despite the stress and high tension that goes along with a project. I also learned that sometimes I have the tendency to practice selective hearing, which I have striven to improve all mod.

Take feedback to heart. Analyze what you feel is wrong and right about the feedback. Try to picture it from your teammates point of view. Have a plan for the next collaboration project so the same problems aren't repeated again.

In my feedback, I really have not had anything that I felt was wrong. I know and understand my faults as a character and I do try to improve them. I must do my best to remember the truth in my feedback and become an even better collaborator on projects.

I have a pretty sweet Johari Window, too. I am curious as to what negvative adjectives my teammates would select for me.

#### Cold Outreach

Remember those contacts everyone found in the Finding Opporunities workshop? Well it's time to start reaching out to them.
Went over how to find someone who works for a company that interests you, and then how to communicate with that person in a friendly way. The goal was to get a tech interview/tour of their job.

So far, of the four I sent, I have gotten responses (and tour's: CaptainU and iTriage) from two of them. My job now is to reach out to more senior level people within companies and send cold outreach to them.

#### Networking

This PD session was about going to networking events and being prepared to picth yourself to people of interest. The idea is to attend networking events and talk with employers in the area. Make them aware of you, make them aware of your story, and leave a strong impression.

Deliverables: Go to two networking events during intermission week.

## D: Feedback

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Josh(Bike Share)

Drew Palazzari [11:45 AM]  
Constructive Feedback: Be more assertive from Day 1.  Frontloading a project at the start makes it less likely to accrue 'intel debt' as the project commences and the group adds more confusing code and files. Josh fell further and further behind at times because he wasn't with Kyle and me the first day the group began work on the project.

You-are-awesome Feedback: When Josh called for a second DTR session, it was very maturely and very professionally done. It was clear Josh was upset, but the group came together, voiced concerns and moved on and built a kick-ass project. Josh is an able bodied coder and I would be pleased to be grouped with him again. Josh did an excellent job getting caught up with the code he did not understand.

Feedback to Kyle(Bike Share)

Drew Palazzari [11:47 AM]  
Constructive Feedback: Don't take on too much work. Kyle did too much work, even after like 8-9 hours of working at school. If there is something Kyle feels NEEDS to be done, even after a day's work,  he should ask  group members for help. Most students at Turing  work hard and are willing to go the extra mile to finish a project. Don't burn yourself out.

You-are-awesome Feedback:  I think our collaborative work styles really meshed well together. Had a ton of fun working on this project with Kyle. Kyle is an excellent coder, and there is a ton to learn from him. I would be very pleased to work with Kyle again. 10/10

Feedback to Nick G. :
 Nick is a lot of fun to work with. He brings a code attitude as well as excellent code to the table. Working with him, there was no challenge that was insurmountable. I hope I work with him on future projects again.

Constructive Feedback: It is hard for me to think of something that Nick needs to improve upon. I would say that a good area to improve, would be to be more available when working remote. Often times, the group would wait for a good amount of time waiting for Nick to check out a pull request. This was not a problem in this particular project (it was not too hard) but it would be a problem for a bigger, more difficult project.

Feedback to Laszlo: 

Positive Feedback: Working with Laszlo has been a real pleasure. Laszlo is an excellent coder, a great personality, and an incredibly intelligent person. His love for tables and thorough testing is legendary (and contagious) and I hope that I get paired with him on a project again.

Constructive Feedback: I think Laszlo's code and intelligence is very high level. Sometimes, this makes it difficult to follow. It would behoove Laszlo to do better at explaining his code in some instances. This is a very small issue however. Considering that English is not Laszlo's primary language, he does a wonderful job of communicating.

Feedback to Daniel: 

Positive Feedback: Daniel did an excellent job as Project Manager. He made sure every card we were given was completed, he was fair, he trusted the team, he's smart, and is a wonderful coder. Daniel was always available for communication and did a really good job of organizing waffle cards and getting the group together for meetings. I would be honored to work with Daniel again on a project.

Constructive Feedback: I challenge Daniel to speak his voice more often. I think he is incredibly intelligent, and I know for a fact he has really good ideas. He is also very quiet. Speak up, Daniel! You're ideas rock. Also, like me, practice your styling.

### Being a Community Member

Josh's Feedback to me:

Josh Cohen [11:51 AM]  
For Drew:  NEG: You can sometimes have ‚Äúselective attention‚Äù, and that can make things challenging for those working with you.  POS:  You‚Äôre a pleasure to work with; especially in a high stress situation.  You relieve the stress by using simple jokes & keeping things ‚Äúlight‚Äù

Kyle's Feedback to me:

Kyle Heppenstall [11:42 AM]
On bike share Drew did an excellent job working collaboratively in a way that worked for the team. He was always available for questions, asked for help when he needed help but still worked independently to get tasks finished. He also did a great job reminding the team to understand code and practice typing it out from memory. My constructive feedback was to take more ownership on figuring out the best way to accomplish tasks like writing dashboard methods. He was hesitant to switch to ActiveRecord from Ruby at first even though it was in the spec and made the pages load faster.

Group Feedback:

Kyle Heppenstall [11:42 AM] (Kyle was the typer)
We stayed late and demonstrated commitment and work ethic. We were willing and ready to resolve conflict on the team while keeping the big picture in mind (and while not being defensive).  We taught each other and did a great job putting learning first. Our work flow of two people pairing and one person working individually kept our pace high. Styling was consistent across all pages.

Group Feedback: We could have used Waffle more often and organized the waffle page better. Our agile approach was not always on point. We should have wrapped up the stations chunk better before moving on to further iterations. The organization of our models directory could have been clearer. We should have focused more on base expectations instead of adding extra features (time cap them). We could have been more detail-oriented when merging pull requests (and creating pull requests that are more discrete and smaller). Communication was too reliant on everyone being here. Styling was minimalist.

Jesse's Feedback to me:

Drew and I paired on many class assignments, including our project Job Tracker.
Drew brings alot of technical capability and ideas to programming and this cohort.
He never shys away from challenging his knowledge with code, and is outstanding 
at expressing his thought processes while programming.

I enjoy having Drew in our cohort, his friendly attitude and willingness to learn 
really enhances the experience of Turing. I look forward to working with, and 
completing future projects at Turing with Drew.

Daniel's Feedback to me: 

Drew is a great person to work with. He always knows the right time to crack a joke whenever the group is starting to get flustered due to a difficult problem. He‚Äôs always willing to do whatever it takes for the team to be successful. He has a thorough understanding of most concepts which gives him the ability to fill in the gaps wherever the team needs him. He can explain what he‚Äôs thinking when he has a better understanding of something and he‚Äôs not afraid to speak up when he thinks we‚Äôre going down the wrong path. Having said all of this, I would encourage him to practice styling. There was a point during the project when we were paired together to style and we ended up wasting time and a not so good looking page.

Nick's Feedback to me:

I had a great time working on little shop with drew. as two members of the group that were keen on pairing, we ended up spending a fair amount of time together working on our cards. He‚Äôs always engaged, and his fun demeanor lifts the mood whenever necessary. On top of that, his knowledge of ruby & rails is thorough. I felt like I could always rely on him whenever a unique solution to a challenge was required. His gifs and atom plugins are on point as well. Look forward to the possibility of coding up something cool in the future with Drew.

Laszlo's Feedback to me: 

Drew has a personality that makes him an immediate culture fit for any team! He is very easy to work with, works extremely hard, works fast and a team member anyone can always rely on! I enjoyed working with Drew very much and seeing how quickly he can bring a concept to life. He is great at getting things up and running, leaving plenty of time for group review and refactoring.

Improvement suggestion: don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions and suggest a different solution. I might have sounded too convincing when you clearly had a better solution. In a team effort everybody is there to ensure the best possible outcome after considering all ideas available.

It has been great working with you!!!

## E: Community Participation

Attended every Gear-up and as many posse meet-ups as I could. Paired with Module 1 students when they signed up for my pairings. Collaborated positively with several of my classmates at many times during Mod 2. I was always available to help people. I was particularly popular for requests for help during Job Tracker.

Nick G and I have paired very successfully on our Little Shop project. Group Harmony is pretty top notch, everyone does their job, has a light hearted attitude, and gets along very well.
