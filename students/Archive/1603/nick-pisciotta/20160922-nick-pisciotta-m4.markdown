#### Scale Up
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/nickpisciotta/electron_notes_app)

Notes:

Great work tackling a hard challenge here. Very professional responses to feedback received on your PR - if I were looking at this repo as someone considering hiring you, I would be comforted by the level of detail on the PRs and professionalism.

You include how to run the app in the PR body here - https://github.com/nickpisciotta/electron_notes_app/pull/5 - make sure to also include those instructions in your README. Also, I suggest linking your blog post. Gives great context for what’s going on there.

* Good UI
* Good Testing
* Look into the underscore method where you can combine arrays in order to iterate over them when you’re performing the same function
* Use “jshint lib” from the command line.
* Abort forEach loops as soon as a condition is true

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### There is an I in Team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

* Take Aways:
  * Our group identified the following attributes that contributed to a successful team experience:
    * Openness and Communication
    * Explicit about each team member's goals
    * Acceptance of one another's strengths and weaknesses
    * Open to learning things you don't know

  * I personally have had a variety of group experiences at Turing, but as I became more aware of the working style of most of my peers in my cohort, I was able to tailor to their needs and expectations. I always try to foster an open and communicative environment, and hope that I give off the sense that I'm open to change and constructive criticism. Collaboration and group work are a large part of this industry, so I will continue to emphasize the importance of a formal or informal DTR, as well as being explicit about my needs and preferences, and those of others, to try and minimize conflict.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

* Take Aways:
  * Avoid depleting so many cognitive resources
    * High expertise helps with cognitive resource management
  * Categorize tasks into three categories:
    * Can't do, but need to (Board A)
    * Can do, but it will take some effort (Board B)
    * Mastered, requires minimal effort (Board C)
  * Try not to pile too many things onto Board B, it drains too many cognitive resources.
  * Split something that's complicated into smaller tasks and gradually move over them over to Board C.
  * Each practice session should only take 45-90 minutes, if longer then it's too complex/big
  * Try to see a lot of high quality and high quantity examples
  * Seeing that throughout my development career I will continually need to learn large, complicated topics, I plan to utilize the strategy of breaking down the topic into smaller components and try to study as many high quality examples that I can.

#### Gear Up - The Gender Gap in Technology

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

* Take Aways:

  * The stark figures presented in this film is a clear indication of the change that needs to happen within this industry. The under representation of women in tech certainly has systemic effects and damages the community and its future. While I have not been exposed to the gender gap within the tech industry, Turing's environment of a relatively balanced male:female ratio will certainly not be emulated in my first job, which will be a severe disappointment. After I familiarize myself with the industry and assess potential opportunities to welcome and encourage more females into tech positions, I will do so.  I know I thrive in a balanced, diverse environment, and I'll challenge and question whomever believes in the orthodoxy that programming is for men.   


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Negotiations

* [Negotations URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/negotiations.md)

* [Link to LinkedIn Summary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-pisciotta)
  * See Summary Section

* [Turing Profile](https://www.turing.io/alumni/nick-pisciotta)

* Takeaways:
  * Say you need the whole picture before accepting an offer--need more time to look things over. "I look forward to seeing the package as a whole"
  * Want them to offer first
  * Thank them for the offer but tell them you need time to look over the documentation.
  * Be upfront if you are talking to other companies
  *  **Always negotiate**
  * Ask for 10% more, expect 5% more
  * Don't negotiate over email
  * Ask for a 3-6 month review if salary is lower than expected.  


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Marcella (Gametime):

Marcella is a very strong programmer and incredibly hard working individual.  She gladly accepts any duty delegated to her, and will not rest until she figures out whatever challenge she's working on. I have worked with her on multiple projects while at Turing, and she always continues to produce high quality work with a can-do attitude. It has been great to work with Marcella, she thrives independently and in a group setting.

### Being a Community Member

Feedback From Marcella (Gametime):

Nick offers rare talent when it comes to programming: strong problem-solving skills and strong collaborative communication skills. I have been fortunate enough to work with him on two projects, and have been impressed with his strong problem-solving skills, the consistency of his contributions to projects (he delivers throughout the duration of the project), and his ability to provide constructive, actionable feedback. His dedication to projects has pushed me to work harder, and I am confident he would be an asset to any team he joins.
