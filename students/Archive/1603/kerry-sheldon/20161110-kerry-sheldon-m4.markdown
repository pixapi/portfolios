# Kerry Sheldon - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I had the following goals for the module:

**Technical**:  Learn Javascript; learn testing in Javascript.

**Other**:  Get a better idea of the jobs I'd be interested in.

I think I generally met my goals, although I wish my JavaScript skills were stronger than they currently are - both with fundamental skills (not related to DOM manipulation) as well as a better sense of best practices in DOM manipulation.  I also didn't get an opportunity to learn how to test client-side Javascript outside of Rails (i.e. DOM manipulation Javascript without Rails/Selenium/Capybara/RSpec)

### End of Module Assessment

Evaluation Scores:

* Satisfactory Progress: 3
* Ruby Style & Syntax: 4
* Rails Style & API: 3
* Javascript Syntax & Style: 3
* Testing: 3
* User Interface: 3
* Workflow: 4

Notes:  Some logic in view re read/unread; more sad path testing.

### Projects

I completed the following project work this module:

#### Scale Up (Independent Study)

* [Production](https://sandiego-police-data.herokuapp.com)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kjs222/police_data)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/week-4-kickoff.markdown)

Project Goals:
* make City of San Diego police incident data accessible, searchable and useable via API as well as access to a relational database dump file.
* help members of the public build effective search queries through interactive API documentation
* help users visualize the data with charts

Learning Goals:
I chose to develop an app completely in Node/Express - with both server side and client side Javascript.  I also chose to explore D3 and libraries built on top of D3 for data visualization.  This was my first time using all of the following technologies:

* Node/express
* Sequelize as the ORM
* D3 for charting
* Dimple JS for charting
* Swagger for API documentation

**Points: 265**

#### GameTime (Partner: Jenny)

* [Production](https://kjs222.github.io/gametime/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kjs222/gametime)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Binary snake is like the [traditional snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game) but instead of eating food, the snake eats bits in order to convert a number from decimal to binary.

**Points: 302 (Check-ins: 170 Eval: 132)**

#### IdeaBox

* [Production](http://mysterious-mesa-11952.herokuapp.com/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kjs222/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

IdeaBox is a single page application with a Rails API. Traditional CRUD functionality is handled through Ajax calls and Jquery/Javascript DOM manipulation/event handling.

**Points: 168**

## Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience
[markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

For me, the framing of responsibilities born out of the rights accorded to us as Citizens of the US was a new (and helpful) way of looking at things.  Having worked with refugees for the prior 5 years, I think I'm less prone to taking the rights of citizenship for granted than I would otherwise be without that experience.  But this session gave me a framework for how to talk to other people about the responsibilities of citizenship in a way that would resonate.

#### Introversion/Extroversion on Teams
[markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I'm pretty familiar with this topic and didn't really take anything away anything "new".  I've learned to build teams that are mixed on this dynamic and I have a lot of respect for different people's needs.  However, I did think it was a very useful exercise to evaluate how Turing does/does not accommodate the needs of both styles.

#### Resilience
[markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

The notion of resilience being a function of (1) internal local of control and (2) perception was a really useful construct for me. While (1) is really natural for me, (2) is more spotty.  Getting reminded that (2) is within my control was super helpful as there are moments where I choose to view situations negatively vs proactively.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Exercise Follow Up
[lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

Through this exercise, I identified the following priorities for requirements in my job search:

* Location
* Must have one of the following:  Building something new/groundbreaking or striving to be the best in its space.
* Must have one of the following:  Mission well aligned with my values or opportunity to touch/be involved in a wide variety of tasks.

Barriers and Action Steps:
* Feeling like I don't have anything to offer the other person in networking situations: Reframe it as providing someone with the opportunity to help someone else (i.e. me)
* Tendency to undersell my knowledge when I only know a small piece of a topic:  Do practice interviews, have a "script" to handle situations where I only know a small piece of the topic.

#### Negotiations

[lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/negotiations.md)
The following were my key takeaways from the negotiations session:
* Get the employer to name the first number on salary by saying that you don't have enough context for the position.
* Don't offer a timeframe for responding to an offer - and always defer a response upon receipt of an offer.

#### Job Shadowing

The following was my key takeaway from job shadowing:
* I do not want to work some place where I only touch a very very narrow sliver of the product.

#### Blog Posts
[lesson plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/writing_a_blog_post_and_peer_review.md)

The following were my key takeaways from the blog post session:
* There are a number of different styles of blog posts to choose from.  Be aware of the style that you are going for.
* Edit/pare down.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(Note: I don't include feedback provided in my portfolios because I believe it's the receiver's choice to include/not include it in their own portfolio)

* I gave feedback to Jenny re: Gametime
* I gave feedback to Jenny on her ScaleUp blog post

### Being a Community Member

**From Jenny (re: Gametime)**
Kerry, you were the best partner to have for gametime and I couldn’t ask for a better experience. You’re an incredibly intelligent person, a fantastic coder, and so easy going. You are able to tackle any challenges and spent time explaining things I didn’t understand to me. We came up with ideas together and it seemed like we were able to decide as a team what to do instead of any one person having more say than the other. I wish I could pair with you forever. I can’t really think of a thing for you to work on, I wish I did. You’re collaborative, creative, skilled, driven, and just over all, well rounded. Thank you for being so damn amazing.

**From Tommasina**
Kerry has once again been a tremendous figure of good will, comfort and programming help for myself and others at Turing. She helped me finish last minute changes to a project before its due date and I witness her helping others with their code projects on a daily basis—even those who have already graduated. She has continued playing a large role in Pahlka Posse helping us develop our healthy eating game and coordinating our student support surveys. As she enters the job force, I have no doubt she will  be a valuable asset to any organization.

### Playing a Part
* I led the student support coordination for Pahlka posse.
* I volunteered at the Boys & Girls club two times this module.
* I started to participate more regularly in Code For Denver project work.
