# Jennifer Soden - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to focus on filling the holes in my knowledge and be a more supportive community member.
Though the last two weeks I experienced burnout for the first time, I think I accomplished my goals.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Andrew

notes:

* finished one consumption story- all information is on the page and displaying correctly
* makes the api call to return 25 total items so the way to get the "total-count" is to count the 17 returned stores and then the 15 for the page is to get the range of the first 15. Not the most desirable way to get these things but it 100 percent works.
* really good tests - maybe add a within scope
* provided api looks ok - mixes respond_to with render.
* I like the destroy action setting head 204

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

### 1. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components*

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 3.5: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Decided to go with a half point because the only things I saw to bring this down was selecting the range of stores within the controller

* 3.5: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.

### 4. Progression/Completion

* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes - This should be a 5!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module I worked on the personal project.

#### Eating is Hard

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MsJennyGiraffe/eating_is_hard)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Eating is Hard is an application to generate random recipes for users. If I user is logged in, they can like ingredients, and it will suggest one recipe with an ingredient that the user likes

Assessor: Sally MacNicholas

Notes:
* Good effort, would have liked to see maybe one more feature, but we talked
 about burnout and how real it is for you right now
* Testing was great, would have liked to see a little more testing for the
 randomness
* Code quality was good. A little struggle on breaking out the logic into the
 right model, controllers, etc.
* Recipe methods a little long, needed to be broken out and also pulled into a
 PORO
* Poor performance due to large amount of results coming back. Talked about
* caching, and pagination to optimize performance

**1. Completion**

* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.

**2. Organization**

* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

### Technical Quality

From Matt:
Jenny, I think you did a great job keeping us on task and avoiding rabbit holes. I think your experience as a developer really showed on this project. Good job, project lead! I think when you're styling, you could be a bit more methodical making sure to put end tags in etc. and it will save you some time. I also appreciated your willingness to shoot for the stars with our features even if it was a bit out of your comfort zone. Overall, I really had a blast coding and bumping music in the basement with you. 10/10 would pair again.

From Trent:
Jenny you did a great job as project manager instructing us to best practices and staying away from chasing rabbit holes and time sinks. As well as focusing on hitting the app specifications requirements. Great job leveraging your experience! But also don't be afraid to tackle new features or try things you haven't seen before with different languages because often they are a lot easier to implement than they appear.

#### Rails Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/rales_engine)

## Project Rubric

**1. Completion**

* 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3.5: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

**3. API Design**

* 3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

**4. Queries**

* 3.5: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.
* 3.5: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.

Jenny, you are an amazing person to work with. You are laid back and low key, which is a super hard attitude to maintain in stressful projects. My only request is that you work on your confidence and optimism. Sometimes you would insult your ability and it makes it hard for everyone else to be confident in you if you aren't. I think you're great at what you do. I just wish your confidence were up to par with my view of you. Thanks for being awesome!

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
### Professional Development Workshops

#### The Gender Gap in Technology

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Did not attend -- I wasn't told that this was going to be included on portfolio. I really couldn't tell you what I was doing a month ago.

#### There is an "I" in "Team"

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

Did not attend -- Was starting to feel exhausted in the module. Probably went home to sleep.

#### (Session Name)

Did not attend -- was paring with a cohort member

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Matt, you were so fun to work with. For the first time in my life, I very much enjoyed pairing. Your positivity and singing makes it feel like like work and more like just hanging out, but still productive. If I had one piece of advice it would be to focus more on git workflow. I know we had an issue early in the project with being on the wrong branch, but you figured it out. It's not a big deal, but something to keep in mind. I am impressed with the quickness of your work, and it's quality. It truly was a pleasure and I hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.

Trent, it was great to work with you and get to know you better. You are a great problem solver and coder. Sometimes you have a lack of focus, and wonder off, but you always get your work done so I don't think it's a big deal. I'm very impressed that you did the action cable portion of the project by yourself.

Nicole, you were a great person to work with though Sales Engine. You always listened to my opinions and made me feel heard. We were always able to work though what few differences opinions we had. I would say, and you know, that you should slow down and read, and make sure you’re doing the things you’re supposed to be doing. In the end, it didn’t really matter and I am extremely happy with our team work and project outcome. Thanks for being such an awesome person to work with and be around.

### Being a Community Member

From Ben:
Jenny continues to be a fantastic member of the Turing community. For the 3rd straight module she has offered to help me and spend time with me making sure I understand what is going on. She is always extremely helpful and willing to help anyone who may need a quick question answered. Jenny is an indispensable member of Turing and a major reason why I am still here. Even when she doesn’t know what the answer is she makes me feel like its ok to try something even if it fails. That is the biggest thing that Jenny does for me and why I am less hesitant to try new things.

From Kris Sparks:
Jenny is always encouraging and willing to help. She has been an enthusiastic and helpful mentor for two consecutive mods. She listens thoughtfully and offers great feedback. Jenny is a great communicator and asset to the community at large.
