## __Professional Skills__

(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (The Gender Gap in Technology)
Participated in the "I want to take action on this at Turing. What can I do?" -we had a great discussion about potentially adding documentary to PreWork, being a person that calls out other people in conversations if they aren't listening to someone else, actively give credit to a person if an idea is repeated that originated with someone else. The sheer act of deliberately trying to be aware and practice active listening can go a long way. Some bias may be very unconscious, but if we are open to that fact for us all, then we have a safe space to explore and learn how to be more self aware and empathetic to perspectives we do not have or understand.

#### (There is an "I" in "Team)
Everyone in my group shared so much. Some of the questions were really personal and even though I was meeting the majority of people for the first time I felt like we established some trust just being open and honest about our answers. Good emphasis on how important it can be to balance being nice and setting boundaries and directives for everyone.

#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)
My group actually shared lots of tips and tricks to timebox, exercise and make meeals for the week on Sundays. I was able to invite everyone to Productivity lunch too, because some of the topics aligned with the things we talk about in our group. Personal strategies are a journey, good to know lots of people keep trying new things to get better and better.

* [Flower Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqdj38JSlahJFPcx76F2WGG4mJjIDyq7hw5wv3YNGsA/edit)

Exercises help take you on a journey from some pretty abstract or ambiguous goals or problem to specific insights or characteristics that can define your strategies and next steps or goals.


#### Feedback to Me

**Project Partners' feedback**
From Karina:
I’m grateful to Turing for an overwhelming amount of things— one that stands out the most to me is the warm embrace of its community.  Coming into Turing, I had the sense that I had been ostracized from a larger community for being too— too “eccentric” in the sense that I was  overwhelmingly vocal of those observations which troubled me.  I’m grateful for my experiences with many individuals at Turing for they have filled me with a sense of purpose and belonging— one that stands out the most to me is the warm embrace of Deb.   Not once have I ever felt like an observer in the presence of Deb, she has this effortlessly beautiful ability to make EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL feel not only included, but cherished and valued.  She instills this sense of self-worth within her partners that helps fully unlock their potential.  She can be very self-deprecating at times but I believe that is simply a side effect of having this talent to not only see but truly *feel* the terrifying beauty that is simply existing… I’m digressing but one point that I feel the need to emphasize is that no conversation, no observation, no interaction has ever felt too ‘heavy’ for Deb, I believe this is because (as cheesy as it sounds) she listens from her heart rather than from her head— that alone, the ability to listen like *that* makes her a strong woman and developer.  I truly feel that the vessel of empathy that is Deb has been and will continue to be an invaluable addition to any development team.  Simply to know her — to be exposed to her giving nature— has been such an empowering experience.

From Roberta:
You did a great job being flexible and supportive at all times during the project. You are always open to other people's suggestions, and you also makes sure that everyone has the opportunity to share their perspectives. You were very proactive on getting the rake task done. Often you talk about yourself in a negative way (' I'm weak / I'm not as good'), and that can influence what people think of you. You brought a lot of value to this project, and I encourage you to give yourself more credit to it, and not to compare yourself with others. Another advice would be for you to be more proactive about asking to drive or taking things/tasks on your own.

From Lane:
Deb, you were an absolute pleasure to work with! You did a wonderful job of calming the tension in our group when issues came up, which speaks to the strength of your soft skills. I appreciate that you would also follow a task until the very end which is a valuable thing to have in another team member. I do think that you could benefit for being more assertive with how you would like to participate and provide to the group. I felt that you may not have gotten all that you wanted out of the pivot and by being more assertive, I think you would be able to get everything that you want out of future projects.

From Nicole:
You are very encouraging and positive as a person. I just wish you were able to contribute more to the project. It always felt like you needed someone there to help you solve issues, but that kind of mentorship isn't always available in the real world. I hope next time you will speak up and request to drive, or take on problems on your own. If you aren't confident on taking on big portions of the project alone, then request to drive so that you don't feel left out of the big picture.

### Giving Feedback
** Project partners' feedback**

To Roberta:
I really enjoyed working with you. You are a confident and tenacious coder. You never shied away from a challenge! Sometimes your passion leads you to frustration, but you are a person that works through conflicts with an honest transparency, which I truly admire. I was inspired and motivated by you, your problem solving process and your open collaborative style throughout our project. Thank you for your dedication to TDD and workflow throughout our project. You are going to be an awesome developer!

To Lane:
Thank you for being a rock and cool head on our project. Your versatility and skill in coding & collaboration are so valuable to everyone on your team. Sometimes I wondered what you were really thinking - you can be a quiet one, but when you did express your opinions they were insightful and well-balanced. I hope you will continue to be outspoken. Your easy going and supportive personality made the long hours and project issues bearable.

To Nicole:
You are an extremely strong coder and super productive. Sometimes your pace feels a bit rushed to me and your process without TDD can make it hard for others to orient to your work or collaborate easily with your process. Thank you so much for working on so much code for our project and building many key pieces of functionality. Really appreciated the times when you expressed patience and tolerance for different coding styles and personalities on our project.
