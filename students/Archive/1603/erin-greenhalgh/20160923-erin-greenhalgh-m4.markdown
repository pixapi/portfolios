# Erin Greenhalgh - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this module shifted somewhat from my goals in the previous mods. During the first half of the mod, I focused on learning JavaScript and trying to dive into the front-end world, which was a bit of a paradigm shift for me. During the second half of the module I shifted my focus to the job hunt. It was important to me to leave Turing with some job momentum. Denver Startup Week was a fantastic opportunity to make some contacts, and I scheduled several coffee meetings and interviews with people that I met there.

At the end of mod 4, in many ways I feel that now my real work begins. I know that the next year will be difficult, transitioning into a new career and honing the skills we have learned at Turing. However I am excited to go into the wild world of development as a member of the Turing community, a group of people who are tenacious and hungry to learn and ambitious and caring and of whom I am glad to be a part.

## A: End of Module Assessment

####Assessment Notes:
I had one minor bug that Meeka helped me fix in the eval. I could work on breaking up my JS functions more, separating view logic from AJAX calls. I could also include a few tweaks to the user interface to make it a better user experience, like giving indicators of what can be edited.

####Scores:
* Satisfactory progress: 3
* Ruby syntax and style: 4
* JS syntax and style: 3
* Testing: 3
* User Interface: 3
* Workflow: 4

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Scale Up

* [Feature Toggle Research](https://gist.github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/ae7cf99bd234b8966dc6357d507d1bdf)
* [Blog Post](https://www.turing.io/blog/2016/09/20/learning-about-machine-learning-introduction)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/looking_for_project.markdown)

* **Week 1:** In week 1 my time was split between doing research on the feature toggle issue for LookingFor and for doing some Mod 5 prework, i.e. ironing out my resume, planning for Denver Startup Week, meeting with my mentor, and scheduling coffee meetings with contacts at companies I am interested in.

* **Week 2:** In week two I primarily focused on Denver Startup Week. I went to several sessions, including a session given by employees at Craftsy about how they restructured their app to have JS logic shared by their web app, iOS app, and Android app, utilizing React and a session given by an employee at Gusto about how they restructured their app from using Rails and jQuery to using React and Webpack. It was really interesting to see these two companies each reiterating the need to have DRYer, more maintainable apps and talking about how React was a key tool in this endeavor. During DSW I also went to several networking events, and I have sent emails to handful of people I met to have coffee and talk more about their work. So far from Denver Startup Week I have had first-round interviews with two companies with second-round interviews scheduled. I also have plans for another coffee meeting and a code challenge for two other companies.

####Evaluation Comments:
Thanks for your feedback and for summarizing/wrapping things up well and being very involved with your team even when pivoting to focus on Start Up Week!

####Scores:
* **Week 1:** 120/150
* **Week 2:** 140/150


## C: Group Work & Projects

###GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lucyfox4131/color-wars)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

####Description:
In this game, users click to place a dot of color on a grey pattern and watch their color race against computer-placed colors to fill the board. We generated and filled patterns using a doubly linked-list structure. The focus of this project was to separate game logic from view logic using entirely client-side Javascript.

####Evaluation Comments:
Overall our game was solid but we had some bugs in the view. We also needed some more testing.

####Scores:
130/150

####Peer Feedback:
**Lucy Fox:** I really appreciated having the chance to work with Erin for game time. Erin has a persistent attitude to overcome all challenges that present in projects which makes her a motivating team member. She does her best to think and explore ideas outside of the box. I did notice on occasion when ideas sometimes led us down rabbit holes Erin tried her best to make them work. On occasion, she may benefit from moving on to a new idea a little sooner. Overall, I'm happy with our final product and I look forward to seeing what Erin is able to accomplish as a developer.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

* [Better at Hard Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)
This was my favorite GearUp session. The problem of having a lot of skills you want to master and not having a good system for mastering them is a constant worry of mine, and I think it makes a lot of sense to be deliberate about mastering a skill rather than toiling halfheartedly at it for a long time. I also found the idea of pattern matching, seeing a lot of good examples of a skill, to be extremely powerful. I want to take this to heart and start "reading" more good code as a tactic to get better at writing good code.

* [I in Team](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)
In this GearUp I appreciated the Brene Brown video. Thought I wish she went into more details about her research, I thought her point that setting boundaries allows you to be a compassionate and empathetic person was excellent. I had never thought about it that way before. It applies to many situations beyond the team DTR. Overall at Turing I feel like reminders like this GearUp have helped my communication skills to improve. Who would have guessed that I'd go to a programming school and come out better at communication.

* [Debugging the Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)
This GearUp was the most charged, for a lot of reasons, including the issues in the community surrounding attending GearUp and the inherently heavy topic. This GearUp went better for me and my group than I expected. The movie was interesting but wasn't anything I hadn't heard before. It made me more depressed than anything. But in our group discussion afterward several of the men said that they never knew that women faced many of these issues and were really receptive to talking about it. I think for the majority of the community it was well worth it to have the conversation.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Telling Your Story, Negotiations, and Technical Interview Tips

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills#negotiations)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/ErinGreenhalgh/87e96dfcf056dad894bd0a40c0a41fbe)

Lia was extremely helpful during all our sessions. Her guidance on navigating the negotiation process was especially helpful.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

**Lucy Fox:** Lucy was a great GameTime partner. She is methodical and a good problem solver. My one piece of advice is that sometimes she can be very adamant about what the right course of action is and sometimes she could give others more space to explain an alternate idea. Overall I really appreciate how reliable and sharp Lucy is and I know that she will excel wherever her career takes her.

### Being a Community Member

See Lucy's feedback above.

### Playing a Part
This mod I continued to be a posse leader for Armstrong Posse. I worked with Jean and Brian from mod 2 to hand many of the organizational responsibilities over to them while giving guidance and supporting mod 1 students with the exercises at meetings. We had a lot of interest in Armstrong this mod and we were able to play with a lot of things, including Google's TensorFlow library, coding up a perceptron (one node in a neural net), and working on machine learning with linear regression.
