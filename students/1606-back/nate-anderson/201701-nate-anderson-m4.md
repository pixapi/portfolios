# Nate Anderson - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to solidify my Rails knowledge as well as begin to dive in to the world of Javascript. I also
wanted to build my social media presence in anticipation of the upcoming job hunt. I also wanted to continue to work
with earlier modules as I really have enjoyed giving back after so much help was given to me at Turing in the 
beginning.

**Description:**

Monocle is a Rails app in which Turing alumni and current students will be able to search companies and job listings.
This was a group project that we worked on the entire module and at the beginning of the module we started off with
a little bit of brownfield code provided by our own Calaway. The condition the app was in when we received it was 
that clients could see an index of companies and see a breakdown of where these companies were geographically in 
listform. Our group has built up the app so now you can do such things as: use our sister app Census to log in, 
see a list of companies on a map when you hit the root page using a gem named Geocoder, be able to filter these 
companies by number of employees and industry, add new companies and locations, star your favorite companies, and
also to be able to leave public notes about these companies.

A fair amount of Javascript/Jquery/AJAX was used in our project as well as we became more comfortable with it as
we progressed through the module. Some of the features that employ this are: filtering companies, adding a public
note for companies (and being able to edit and delete the note if you authored it), and also being able to 
star a company of your liking. After we got our bearings with the project, a majority of time was spent trying
to implement these features and get them working with our existing code. 

We also were able to spend some time trying to implement some features in React. We were not able to fully implement
the feature but I believe the time spent was very valuable in understanding React on a deeper level. We attempted
to implement the starred companies page using react and we began by creating a starred companies component. After 
being able to pull in all the starred companies using an api call, we next attempted to build a company card
component where we would iterate through our starred companies and render each company card on the starred companies 
page.  This is where we left off but I think a large amount of progress was made towards our goal.

Overall, I really loved working on Monocle. The group I had was very diligent and tried as hard as we could to 
implement the necessary features while also balancing new learning and pushing ourselves forward. The varying
degrees of Javascript implementation proved the toughest part as this was new for all of this but also proved to 
be a great learning experience. My favorite aspect was probably how closely this project parelleled real working
conditions and how things would be in a real life job situation.

**Feedback to Me:**

From Dan Broadbent: Nate, I’m really glad we finally got to work together on a big project.  You were awesome to pair with.  When we were working together on figuring out how to filter our data with scopes, we got it to a great flow and it was the most fun I had all project.  I felt that I got to know you a lot better as a person and a programmer during this project.  Your positive attitude and willingness to take on any problem were a real asset to the team.  I’d be happy to work with you again.

From Susi Irwin: Nate, your analytical nature makes you such a pleasure to work with on projects and specifically on Monocle. You are not afraid to ask the tough questions of the Tech Lead, the Team, or the application itself. It is an absolute blast to work through problems with you. You have a knack of looking at the code and the problems from a different angle that I don't see. Your keen sense and intuition are incredible. Your work on Monocle has been outstanding.

From Brendan Dillon: Nate Anderson - Working with you on Monocle has been great. You always were able to bring a sense of calm reasonableness to a sometimes panicky project. You have a really good sense for structuring a project in a clear, modular way. I really enjoyed pairing with you throughout this project, as you really brought a step-by-step sensibility but accommodated for my spaghetti-flinging sensibility. Your clear-headedness brings a lot to a team, and I look forward to seeing what you are able to do after Turing.

### Gear Up

#### Microagressions
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)
Microagressions were a very interesting topic as it is very hard to deal with someone who is not overtly trying
to be insulting, and even may not know they are doing it. I think a lot of these times it is important to look at
the unique situation that is presenting itself at that time and whether it is worth it to engage with this person
who may be acting ignorantly. If it has hit a point where it has been bothering you enough to engage in a further
conversation with this person, steps must be taken to ensure the conversation continues in a respectful manner.

#### Journey Mapping
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)
Empathy is such a huge life skill to have and can endear you to so many people in the process. In life and at 
Turing specifically it is very easy to get wrapped up in your own problems and struggles and sometimes a little 
perspective is needed that you aren't the only one struggling. And someone else might be struggling just as much 
but in a completely different way. This relates to clients to be able to put yourselves in their shoes to see what 
concerns they may have and ultimately relate enough to build something that will solve their needs. And the only way to do this is to fully understand them. 

#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
Grit was a particularly interesting session strategically placed near the end of the module, which I'm assuming was no mistake.  The central theme of the session was basically that sometimes work ethic and perseverance are not enough. The passion for what you are doing also needs to be present as well to give you the full potential for success. This was interesting to me because I always saw myself as someone with a very strong work ethic but until getting into Turing, I don't know if I really had the passion to go along with it. Staying up on those late nights, working 12 hour days, it all becomes worth it when you get tests to finally pass or programs to finally run.

Feedback from Susi Irwin: Overall Impressions: Well done! Such an important topic!!! Love the screenshots!
Structure & Formatting - easy to follow, flows in a logical fashion.
Grammar & Syntax - I would add a comma before the 'but' in this sentence: "Waffle has a lot of very useful features, but another project management tool that is a little more robust is Pivotal Tracker.
General Comments - This is a great post! i LOVE the comparison of Waffle and Pivotal. You show great uses for both and point out great use cases. Well done!

### Giving Feedback

To Susi Irwin: Susi, it was so much fun to work with you again on a project. You keep everyone involved and engaged
and are just a fantastic team member in general. Your inquisitive nature helps me to clarify things I might not 
have even realized I was somewhat confused about myself. Watching how much you have grown as a developer in the
last 7 months has been amazing to watch. Your contributions to this project were immense and I can't wait to see
what you do in the future at Granicus and beyond. 

To Dan Broadbent: Dan, it was really great that we finally got to work on a project together. I feel like we both
have a very similar demeanor and that showed during our pairing time together, which was always really productive 
and enjoyable. You were a fantastic project manager and were able to keep us organized and moving forward even 
when at times during the project we didn't feel like we had much guidance. I would definitely enjoy working with you
again and am interested to see what you do beyond Turing. 

To Brendan Dillon: Brendan, it was great to be able to work with you again on a project. Your work ethic is fantastic
and your tenacity when attacking a problem is really impressive. You were easily one of my favorite people to pair with
during my time at Turing and would always crack me up with your one liners. You also seemed to really become more
and more comfortable as the modules progressed in expressing your opinion and making your voice heard. You are one
of the most talented programmers in the cohort so I'm happy to see your confidence grow and I can't wait to see what you accomplish in the future. 

### Being a Community Member

I was able to work with a number of module 1 and 2 students during the past six weeks and I always enjoy it. I very much
remember the struggles of early modules and I received a lot of help myself so it is always very gratifying to work with
earlier module students. I estimate that I worked with 1-2 students a week at varying times.

### Playing a Part

Regularly provided assistance to peers, continued in prework guides slack channel to provide assistance to incoming Turing students.
