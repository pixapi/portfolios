## Self-Solicited Feeback
This module I think was a result of pushing myself so hard the previous three mods.
I'm sure it was a combination of many factors, but I frequently found myself losing track
of HW assignemnts, submission forms due, and minor spec requirements on projects and assessments.

I think the pressure of the job hunt caused a lot of distractions that made it difficult to focus
on assignments. Having picked up JS and React prior to mod4, the journey this module wasn't as
exciting as it was for the rest of my cohort learning JS for the first time. As a result of feeling
burned out, I couldn't find the motivation to learn a new thing either. However I think that once
I'm back in control of my every day schedule that I will be able to get back to productivity fairly
quickly.


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)


### Gear Up
#### Vote your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

#### Resilience
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

On the Vote your Conscience gear up, I chose to dig into Vetting Leaders, which brought up the idea that us as voters
like to select the candidate that appeals to our emotions the most - even if we don't know it. We select candidates based
on whether they come off as confident, whether they come off as trust-worthy, without digging into their policy.

On Resilience, I like to think that resilience is a trait I've carried with me after growing up in a very turbulent
household. As people, we can't possibly prepare ourselves for every possible outcome, but the next best thing is to
be able to come out of an ugly situation knowing that the power is still in your hands.

### Professional Development

#### Top 3 Job Priorities
I'd like to work at a consultancy where I can continue to explore what technologies are exciting
to me and continute to develop my technical skills. With that said, there are many things about
consultancies that are a real turn-off.

1) Mentorship. I like to think I can pick up these concepts very quickly,
so I think a mentor that can recognize my willingness and ability to constantly improve will be able to point
me in the right direction career-wise.

2) Travel & Hours. Consultancies are notorious for sending their employees on far away trips and working
long hours. I'm someone who does their best work when I'm in a comfortable routine, and long hours
with lots of travel is sure to consistently throw me off my game.

3) Experiment with new things. I want to work for a company that invests in my ability to learn new things,
not investing in what I already know.


### Action Plan for Overcoming Barriers
I'm planning on relying heavily on code challenges in order to showcase my skills. Being someone without a
large network or strong networking skills, I think outperforming on code challenges is the best
way to leverage an advantage.


### Blog Post

* [Blog](https://medium.com/@powderedruckus/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-64305ce3e086#.9c1hrxqep)

Review:
Matt Rogers: a bit of confusion in your messaging here. You talk about Redux, and React Router,
but I don’t feel like you separate the problems you’re solving with those solutions from the thing
you spend the most time taking about in your post, which is DND.

Use headings and such to break up the paragraphs to tell a better story. Refactor the questions you
ask when talking about the potential problems into bullet points so that it’s more obvious to the reader
these are the things you’re going to solve.

I do definitely like the moral of the story of implementing something yourself so you can see the pitfalls
before (or instead of) just reaching for whatever library first.


### At least 3 interviews
8th Light: Currently in the application process with 8th Light submitting a code challenge.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Roberta Doyla - I  enjoyed working with you on GameTime and Scale-Up. You’re very good at communicating what
you’re thinking and making sure that the spec/project requirements are always being met. I really enjoyed watching
you pick React and Redux so quickly, and I especially appreciated your willingness to reach out for help when you
felt stuck. I’m confident that you’ll make an immediate impact on any team you end up working on next,
and I wouldn’t hesitate to work with you again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

From Roberta Doyle - I enjoyed working with you during this module. You have a strong knowledge of JavaScript, React and Redux.
I definitely learned a lot from pairing with you. You’re committed to the projects you work on and with the quality of
the code you write. My only suggestion would be to communicate a little bit more, a few times I felt I had to ask how
you were feeling about the project or follow up with you.  I’m excited to see what you’ll do next!


### Playing a Part

Cohort members know that I am constantly on-call and available for help if they need it.

More than any module prior, I spent more time this module helping my cohort since they know
I've been studying JavaScript for a while.

Always participating in class.
