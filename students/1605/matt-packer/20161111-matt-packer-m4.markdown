## Cumulative Module Score (from Tracker)
* **1024/1140**
* **89.82%**

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following section consists of one evaluated individual project:

### Scale Up

* [EarlyBird Swift](https://github.com/matthewrpacker/EarlyBird)
* [Scale Up Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/week-4-kickoff.markdown)
* [Independent Study Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

I chose to pursue an independent study with a focus on learning Swift and incorporating what I learned in a presentable project.  In Module 3, I built [EarlyBird](https://github.com/matthewrpacker/early_bird), an online golf tee time booking system. With this, I built a separate [EarlyBird API](https://github.com/matthewrpacker/golf_courses_api) to serve up golf course data (names, addresses, phone numbers, images, and tee times). My goal for Scale Up was to build a native iOS App that would compliment my Module 3 project, EarlyBird.

Below is a demonstration of the App:

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following section consists of one evaluated team project:
* [GitHub URL for UFO](https://github.com/kbs5280/game-time)

#### Game Time: UFO

* [GitHub URL for UFO](https://github.com/kbs5280/game-time)
* [Game Time](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Students were required to build a game that is playable in the browser. This project did not include a server-side component. Students used exclusively client-side JavaScript to complete the project.

UFO is a single-player, side scroller, 2D collision-detection game wherein a player controls a UFO using the spacebar to 'ascend' and 'descend' in order to avoid colliding with oncoming astroids. Upon impact with an asteroid the game is over.

Below is a demonstration of the game:

## D: Professional Skills
This section includes information on Gear Up and Professional Development Workshops.

### Gear Up

#### Resilience: 11/4/16

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

Resilience is something that I truly value and try to incorporate into my life. Because of past experiences, I was able to relate to both the topic and the value that resilience can bring into one’s life.  I really agreed that a significant component to resilience is the person’s attitude.  My most resilient moments have been a result of reducing externalities to a more workable timeframe.  For example, if something as a whole is creating a lot of stress in my life, I try to reduce the scope to just one day. Also, if there is regret present, I try to understand that regret is useless unless it promotes future change.  What I mean is, there is no value to regret something unless it leads to some action. Therefore, if you can use that regret to change you life for the better, these future actions can add value and purpose to that regret.  


#### Introversion: 10/21/16

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

Have you ever been in a team setting where the differences between introverted and extroverted working styles was clear. What were the benefits and challenges of the styles?

I think most teams I have worked on had a balance of introverted and extroverted personalities.  I usually saw that this combination itself was beneficial to the team.  Oftentimes, when faced with a new problem, we would spend time individually researching a solution.  This allowed each team member to attempt to solve the problem in their own way. This approach accommodated introvert personalities.  However, many times it was helpful for someone to speak up to get conversions and ideas flowing.

#### Vote Your Conscience: 10/07/16

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

The responsible thing to do is to participate in a process that should ultimately impact your way of life.  Therefore, every citizen should consider it an obligation and a privilege to vote.

The idea of citizenship places a responsibility on citizens to “participate in the democratic process”.  Therefore, for the system to work, citizens need to be aware of this responsibility and take action.

I think many people feel that their vote may not matter, or that it may not impact the result of a specific election.  This mentality could result in less people voting and the system’s policies would only reflect a small minority of the people that vote.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Workshop With Allison: 10/5/16

##### Top Three Job Priorities:
**Highly structured work environment (training and schedule)**

I really enjoy structure.  I have done well in both structured and unstructured environments, but I have a preference for working in a structured environment i.e. solid training program, in-office work schedule, clear weekly directives.

**New product division - product development life-cycle**

I would love to join a team where I can help contribute to all stages of the product lifecycle.  This is an area of interest and I believe that my experiences as a student at Turing, combined with my M.B.A., will allow me to become a valuable member of a new-product team.

**High level of exposure / influence**

I believe that I would benefit from working at a smaller company.  I like the idea that my performance would be visible to the entire organization.

**Barriers:**
- Entering tech industry
    - Being new to the industry
    - Lack of experience

- Networking
    - Sometimes feels Transactional / Fake

- Interviewing
    - Fear of not having the answers
    - That I might have a bad day

- Personal Branding
    - Personal brand may not be unique or special
    - So many people apply for the same position

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

##### Game Time

To Kris Sparks:

"I really enjoyed working on Game Time with Kris.  He demonstrated enormous commitment, drive, and problem solving capabilities throughout each iteration of the project.  I valued how he would walk me through his thought process, demonstrate his theory in code, and respond intelligently to suggestions.  Kris has a talent for breaking complicated problems down to approachable steps.  This helped us progress as a team and ultimately deliver a project that we were both proud of.  I think Kris may benefit from periodic reflection on progress made.  I think by taking a step back from the problem at hand and visualizing what has been accomplished, he can continue to progress successfully.  I think he is tremendously talented and a strong problem solver, so this reflection will provide him with more confidence to handle the next challenge.  I truly believe that Kris will be a valuable asset to any company that he decides to join."

##### Scale Up

"I really enjoyed the Scale Up project, but here is some feedback:

I see the value of optional classes (provides students with a flexible schedule to look for jobs or work on what they view as most important), but I often felt conflicted whether I should attend class or work on my project.  Basically, I know there were some classes that I would have liked to attend, but I felt as though I needed to spend that time working on my project.

I think Scale Up would be a terrific post-Turing project.  For example, if students have not yet found a job, Scale Up would provide instant structure, an opportunity to learn something outside of the curriculum, and maintain the student network.  This may help students feel more connected while adjusting to life after Turing."

### Being a Community Member

##### From Kris Sparks

"Working with Matt on Game Time was a great experience. Matt is patient and a great collaborator. He works systematically and strategically. His commitment to project management and Git workflow is excellent. He approaches problems at the most basic level and then works to solve the problem. Matt is willing to try new approaches. He works to find out solutions when it’s challenging and frustrating, without getting frustrated himself. He is hard working and is committed to learning, and that will serve him well in his next endeavor.”

### Playing a Part

I did my best to support the Turing community by:
* Actively participating in class.
* Actively participating in the Scale Up PR-Rodeo channel.
  * Reviewing / Submitting pull requests and blogposts.
* Offering fellow cohort members assistance when I felt that I was in a position to help.
