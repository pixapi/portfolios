# Zack Forbing - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Module 4 has been great and terrifying. I thrive in structure, so learning to navigate this mod was a big learning experience for me. My areas of emphasis this mod were on learning Javascript (ES6 specifically) and learning React.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The work this mod has been like a rollercoaster. Scale Up felt very laid back and relaxed, while GameTime was really intense. IdeaBox(JS) was a great introduction to JavaScript, and GameTime built even more on that foundation. Scale Up felt a bit aimless, but ultimately I was able to get a lot out of it.

Idea Box JS was a great intro to JavaScript for me, and I had a lot of fun creating it. The app is a rebuild of the original IdeaBox, this time as a single-page app that, when finished, works entirely client-side, using API calls to communicate with the database.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group work was the bulk of the module for me. I continued to hone my skills as a leader, or at least an assertive team member, over the course of the module. I've definitely been challenged and pushed creatively by my group work with Yoseph, Kris, and Jenny.

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/game_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

GameTime was a blast, and hair-tearingly frustrating at the same time. Working with a partner half your age is also a challenge, but after our experience together on Rails Engine, we got right down to business. Our GameTime project was TimeFreeze, an infinitely scrolling top-down shooter game. The format of this game was a huge challenge, and ended up eating a lot of time spent. We also imposed a constraint on ourselves of working entirely in ES6.

Feedback from Yoseph:
Zach, on Gametime things were on a different level than when we worked with each other during Rails Engine. You plowed the way during the project and for us to not get stuck on the canvas when it proved difficult. You added elements of your graphic design background into the graphics of the game making it much more pleasing on the eyes than squares. I really appreciated how much you were willing to go towards ES6 when it was not taught in class and was happy when you started getting the hang of it. The one thing I would improve on (included then both of us) would be to plan out code and the interaction, and not so much on the visual canvas aspect. It was also recommended by Regis that the way mentioned above was the best way to approach this problem. Overall I am happy with the progress we made and the game we created. Wish you best of luck in your future!

#### ScaleUp - LookingFor

* [Week 4 Submission Form](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1605/module_4_assignments/scale-up-week-4/zack_forbing)
* [Week 5 Submission Form](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/module_4_assignments/scale-up-week-5/zack-forbing-week-5.markdown)

On ScaleUp, I wanted to work in one of the brownfield projects. I figured that would be good practice for my first few weeks at my first software development job, since it is very likely that I'll be working on an existing codebase. The project I felt was entirely successful. I paired with Kris Sparks to work on the Favorite Jobs feature and with Jenny Soden on pulling the API calls out into a Service POJO. I also wrote a blog post (linked later) detailing the process of getting up to speed in a brownfield project. I felt like this project really helped me sharpen my github committing and commenting skills as well.

Feedback from Kris:
Working with Zack is always a positive experience. Of all the things that stand out, the thing that stands out the most to me is his willingness to take on any problem. He is always willing to dig in and find a solution regardless of the issue. We both need to continue to work on time-boxing our work and managing our time efficiently. Zackâ€™s commitment to learning and working hard is notable and will serve him well in whatever is next.

Feedback from Jenny:
Zack, it was a nice (finally) working with you on refactoring the service on scale up. I feel like it was nice being able to jump around in code with you when neither of us had a solid idea of what was going on, but I felt comfortable enough to ask questions without feeling judged. On the project as a whole, I really appreciated the fact that you were dedicated to understand what was going on and draw out the hierarchy tree, which helped me a lot in order to see the scope of the project. That being said, I think you could work on gaining confidence. Working with you, you seemed to have an idea of what was going on and how React worked, but were never really confident in what you were doing. I really enjoyed working with you on this project. I feel as though your spirit uplifted me, and made the project easier to work on. I feel like your light-heartedness is a great attribute you bring to a team. Keep it up!

## D: Professional Skills

As far as professional skills go, I think the biggest thing that happened this mod was the job shadowing experience I had. I shadowed with Spire Digital, and after showing us around, and talking about their tech stack and industry, they told all of us that they don't hire juniors from bootcamps. What struck me by the end of my experience is that they SHOULD. After pairing wit hone of their workers, I felt my impostor syndrome virtually disappear, as I didn't feel that the person that I shadowed would have gotten through a program as intense as Turing.

I've also built a good-looking resume, and have applied to one job (allstate) so far.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

this gear up really didn't change my mind about not voting. I still think not voting is dangerous, and akin to taking your hands off the wheel of your car because you don't like the bumpiness of the road. I was drawn to the first topic because the article ("Is America an Oligarchy?") hit close to how I feel about our government anymore.

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I personally don't believe that anyone is entirely introverted or extroverted. it's a spectrum, not a dichotomy, and people generally fall closer to the middle of the spectrum on one side or the other when they are with friends, and nearer to the ends of the spectrum with strangers. I can definitely appreciate the differences, as I identify as someone more on the introverted end of that spectrum.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I was not present at this Gear Up due to making up hours on ScaleUp, but I definitely think that the Turing experience alone is an incredible resilience builder. I feel like a changed person having been through this experience, and I've experienced a lot of tough life experiences while working my way through the curriculum, like the dissolution of my marriage and my ex-wife's father being diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer. It has been a difficult road, but I have found a lot of resilience in sharing my experiences with others.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Overcoming Job-Hunting Imposter's Syndrome

This session was very helpful in pinpointing the things that I want out of a job, namely, mentoring, pairing, and education opportunities. My main barrier is a lack of confidence (although I feel like this is changing lately).

#### Negotiating

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/negotiations.md)

The negotiation tips we received from Lia are incredibly helpful for me since I have a hard time really talking myself up. it's a confidence booster to know that we aren't going to be dropped immediately if we counter-offer. it was also good information to know that for hirers to demand my previous salaries is illegal, and they can ask, but I don't have to respond.

#### Blog Writing and Peer Review

* [Workshop URL](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BtFtpS_OWhQp9AJbXc9woI5ql8sD-etxwnFc-4rixEI/edit#slide=id.p)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables: Blog Post](https://medium.com/@zackforbing/where-to-begin-with-lookingfor-202803ecf1b0#.8qn8yojgr)

I hadn't really done much of my blog yet, but this session helped me flesh out some ideas for what I could write about, and I got to work building the outline that would become this blog post later.

#### Top 3 Job Search Priorities

1. Research Jobs/Companies in Denver
2. Attend lots of meetups to network and learn
3. Reach out to my friend connections

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

feedback to Kris Sparks:
Kris was a great team lead during ScaleUp. We had the opportunity to pair together on building out the Favorite Jobs functionality, and pairing with Kris is always a pleasure. Kris is great at communicating what he is thinking, and listens very carefully when you are explaining something or talking through ideas on how to implement something. Even more, Kris is an absolute workhorse on his own. He really puts in the hours and does what it takes. I'm glad I got another opportunity to work with Kris, and I know that he won't have a problem in his new career.

feedback to Jenny Soden:
Jenny, on ScaleUp I was glad to have an opportunity to work with you on the service object. feeling our way through the code felt natural, and I liked the back and forth of it. you have a confidence in owning who you are personally that I find refreshing. I would have liked to see you group up more in Scale Up, I think it would have helped your focus on the project a bit more. although I might just be selfish, because working with you was fun, and I wish we could have gotten some more accomplished together. independent of coding, you're really funny and easy to talk to, and I really appreciated getting to know you these last two mods on the stoop telling people to enter Patagonia around the corner. if i had to say anything you could work on, I'd say that you should be mindful of your focus (although that might just be a result of being at Turing for six mods). Keep owning who you are, loudly. The right kind of people will take notice of that.

feedback to Yoseph Anderson:
Yoseph -
on gametime, you were a champ. I really appreciated you letting me puzzle things out for myself sometimes, but not letting it get too far down the rabbit hole. your javascript ability is exceptional, but I would have liked to see you put more passion into it. I was, however, thankful that you expressed your feelings about wanting to focus on the job hunt. I can't really blame you for that. You've been studying JS since mod 1, so I know that the project was a different experience for you than it was for me. I was really appreciative of you pushing for us to build it out in ES6, it has helped my understanding of the differences between ES5 and ES6, although it was a source of frustration at the time. I know if we had had more time we could have figured out all the particulars of our game instead of just the MVP. Thanks for a great project!

feedback to Susi Irwin:
Susi has been a great support to me this module. when I was going through some heavy stuff, she made herself available to talk about it, and offered some great insights. I've had opportunities to see her at work as well, and her modesty belies her quick thinking and monstrous work ethic. Susi was very active this mod with Impostors, having taken over leadership of the group, and she leads by example. All of these things together - leadership, empathy, work ethic,  and quick thinking - make Susi a well-rounded developer that I would be honored to have on my team.

### Being a Community Member

feedback from Susi Irwin:
Zack has been an amazing support this module - for me and for our other community members. He routinely comes to our imposter lunches and supports and encourages all members. He has been a constant source of encouragement and positivity to me throughout my career at Turing. He never shies away from offering a second set of eyes, helpful hints, or just cheering. Zack is a talented developer who will be sorely missed in the Turing basement, but I am extremely excited to see the wonderful work he will be doing as he graduates from the program. Personally and professionally I consider myself extremely fortunate to have Zack in my life.

### Playing a Part

I'm always trying to help clean up around here - usually the dishwashers, which are perpetually behind the demand for cups and mugs. I have taken time out to pair with Mod 1 students over the course of the module, sometimes significant amounts of time while juggling my own projects. I also actively supported the Impostors Group and was involved with Jenny Soden's decision to create the support slack channel.
