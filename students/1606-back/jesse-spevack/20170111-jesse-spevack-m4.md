# Jesse Spevack - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to get a job by the end of the module. To do so I focused on the following:
* Cold outreach - I've sent at least 35 emails and had over 21 meetings / calls.
* Improve Rails proficiency - I continue to focus on TDD, but I've also gained experience working on my largest App to date with Census.
* Gain front end framework proficiency - In addition to the class work, I've done several React Tutorials on my own, in addition to using React on Census and the Final.

#### Open Source
* [GitHub PR](https://github.com/applegrain/creact/pull/24)
I worked with Raphael on updating Lovisa's Creact Tutorial. The tutorial covers how to build a React front end that gives the user full CRUD functionality on a Rails API. We added a new section on how to add filter functionality in react so that the user can filter skills based on the level of the skill using a drop down. We describe the following four steps in our PR for the tutorial:
  * Creating a FilterSelect component
  * Writing the FilterSelect component to a filter function in the Body component
  * Writing the filter functionality, which will set the state of the Body component and render all the filtered skills
  * How to refactor the code to make it clear and DRY.

## D: Professional Development
### Professional Development Workshops

##### Description of your top three priorities in the job search and why
My three top priorities for my first dev job are location, salary and career path. In terms of location, my wife and I moved to Colorado a year and a half ago. We were very deliberate about the place we wanted to live and have children and still feel strongly that Colorado is going to be our long term home. So for me, finding work ideally in Denver, Boulder, or a remote situation that allows me to continue living with my family in this glorious state. Regarding salary, I want to be able to support my family so that my wife can have more flexible time and prioritize childcare above financial concerns. So there are salary points that make that possible for a family of four and some that do not. Finally, having a first job that improves my marketability over time is also important. I want to work with technology that has many use cases. I want to work on a team that I can learn from or have significant opportunities for self guided study and professional development.

##### Action plan for how to overcome perceived barriers to the job search
There are a few perceived barriers that I think are preventing me from moving forward with my job search. First, I am new to the Colorado technology scene so itâ€™s hard to know what is out there in terms of opportunities at interesting companies. To overcome this barrier I am reaching out to my existing network for recommendations about companies to look at.

Another barrier is just not knowing a particular technology that a company uses but convincing them that the skills I learned at Turing are applicable in their context and that I can quickly add value. I think getting active in open source might mitigate this problem.

Goss's Feedback:
Overall Impressions

I don't think anyone would be surprised to learn you made a very good educational post which clearly explains the topic. I like the title it's, good imagry. The audience is explicitly defined early on. I defintely hear your voice coming trhough.

Structure & Formatting

There is good structure. Beginning and middle are clearly well developed. The end is a bit abrupt "We did it! Kthxbai." The shots and code help a user easily follow your progress. It might be useful to experiment with fewer images to see how many you can cut without harming comprehension, since many of them are the same with small variations. Hypothetically a user is going to follow along and could see what you describe on their own output.

Grammar & Syntax

Language is clear and direct. A candidate for 'tightening' the post would be to remove the "We sure are handling that search..." step and go right to the console log step. I see why you did it, but if you choose to eliminate something, this is where I'd start.
The punctuation and vioce are great, almost as though you did this professionally for a while.

Final Words

This is a really solid post. Every step has beautiful images and helpful code snipets. Well done!

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
Calaway: I am really impressed by the leadership and ownership you showed throughout the Census project. My impression is that you were really the driving force behind prioritizing cards, understanding what work needed to be done, and also pumping out cards. I think you also took on some very technically demanding challenges, most recently getting YearBook talking to Census, and providing me with a lot of guidance on authenticating our own API. In terms of areas of growth, not many come to mind. It was a real pleasure being teamed with you this module.

Goss: I am so glad that I go the chance to formally work with you this module. You are kind, patient, and a great problem solver. I think you took on a number of technical challenges that really helped our group. in particular you took the lead on implementing Doorkeeper and really running out on point with regards to the entire OAuth process. I enjoyed pairing with you and benefited each time from the calm, systematic approach you take to coding. I appreciate that you are also eager for feedback and ways to improve. To that end, I get the sense that you have a tough time making decisions. I think this is because you are so analytical and both relish and revel in the process of evaluating strategies. You need to get better at pulling the trigger. I think a chess analogy is fitting here. If you have two players, one an expert and the other a novice, often times the expert might take longer to decide a move than a novice because the expert is more fully appreciative of the choices and consequences available to them. While I do not know what is going on in your head, I suspect it is something akin to the expert pondering her next move in a chess game. My reason for thinking this about you is some of the conversations we have had about the job search and things you've said in passing about your own work habits. All that said, I do not believe any of this manifested itself in anyway in our project. I think you were more than an able contributor and partner for the entirety of the module. Thanks for working with me!

Jasmin: I would jump at the chance to work with you after Turing. You bring such a tremendous technical and professional skill set to the table. You took a lot of challenges on that were key to our projects success. In particular you were responsible for setting up emails and our production / staging environments. You are hyper-organized and contributed greatly to our team's project management and communication efforts. In terms of areas of growth, I would say be more assertive and confident. You have real expertise in a lot of areas and you are highly competent. Trust your bullshit meter and do not be afraid to call people out when that meter starts beeping. I always imagine myself starting some entrepreneurial venture. You are on the short list of people I have worked with over the course of my career that I would want to partner with on that (so watch out).

### Being a Community Member

Calaway:

This is the second project at Turing on which I have had the pleasure of working with Jesse. I have many good thing to say about the experience, but my favorite aspect is how Jesse has a way of bringing the best work out of his teammates. This is not done through taking a manager role or telling anyone what to do, but by being a role model and constantly putting in his top performance.  

Overall I could not be more impressed by Jesse's work ethic as well as his ability to produce excellent code. I can see my own growth in technical skill and even more in my teamwork abilities as a direct result of working with him. I'm very happy for the opportunity to work with Jesse, and more than that, to be able to call him a friend.

Goss:

You're clearly a very talented developer and teacher. Any team you're on will become multiplicatively better because of that combination.
I can tell you put a lot of pressure on your self. You seem to be aware of this, and you mentioned it in the DTR at the beginning of the module. Hopefully the security of having an income will allow you to relax, but I can tell you value the time you have and of those around you.
You are exceptionally articulate and funny. I benefited greatly from meeting you here and I hope to keep in touch.

Jasmin:


### Playing a Part

* Paired with Mod 1 students
* Participated in the Name.com Hackathon
* Participated in the Turing Parents panel discussion
* Participated in the Mod 1 Grit panel discussion
* Led 1 Friday Spike on job searching

### Gear Up

#### Microaggressions
I did not participate in the Microaggressions gear up because I was a pannelist at the Module 1 gear up on Grit.

#### Journey Mapping
[Notes from session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RGJwjzlvKeHTMx4SP1DU5iYJ3E162hYYEqLvfnYBS2c/edit)

#### Grit
My takeaway from this session is that module 5 in many ways will take more grit than the rest of Turing, possibly combined. I know that I will be able to trust my relationships with my cohort to help support me through this challenge.
