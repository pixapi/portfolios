### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to learn more about Apis and be able to explore them further beyond my knowledge building Node.js apis. Also, to grow more and continue to help others as well as learn how to work better as a group.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Best Buy Api

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Yoyo2Code/module_3_assessment)

Consume Best Buy's Api to find nearby stores, as well as create an internal API.

#### Api Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Yoyo2Code/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

Using Github Api to explore the internals of an external Api.

* Could have refactored the data into objects and displayed those into views.
* Could have refactored Github Service to have an initialize method so that there is no repeat in the base url.

Possibly 3 or 2 if graded.

##### Feedback

From Pat:
You definitely stepped up as team lead the second half of the project. I especially liked how you were able to keep calm towards the end when the pressure was on. Great job w/ Heroku.

From David:
You brought an open mind, a good sense of humor, and a lot of creative ideas into this project. I appreciated your willingness to try out new solutions and always have a discussion about what direction to take. Since you were the project manager, I would have liked to see you be more organized and take a more proactive role with the waffle cards and laying out priorities for the group. You had some really great ideas, but sometimes they were difficult to understand because they seemed off topic, sandwiched between a bunch of other ideas, or presented tentatively. I think you could benefit from learning to recognize when your ideas are straying off topic and find ways to articulate your thoughts more clearly and assertively. When you took on a feature on your own, you always delivered, and so you should be confident in your abilities. You are extremely smart, friendly, and curious, and I enjoyed working with you.

From Jason:
Yoseph was the project lead, and overall did a very good job. He took feedback from the rest of the team very well, and was able to adjust on the fly. His technical skills were a huge asset on this project. There were times where he could have been more assertive given his skillset, but those moments weren't frequent enough to be a concern.


#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/rales_engine)

Advanced ActiveRecord queries to display sales data.

1. Completion
**3: Project completes most requirements but fails 3 (5 for individual project) or fewer spec harness tests.**

1. Test-Driven Development
**1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.**

2. Code Quality
**3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

3. API Design
**3: Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.**

4. Queries
**3: Project makes good use of ActiveRecord, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods.**


##### Feedback

Yoseph, you were absolutely instrumental to our team on RalesEngine. Your ability to explain your process really helped me to form my own process for building the business intelligence endpoints. In the future, though, I think you might benefit from stepping away from issues you are having. I know the test suite was a point of frustration for you, and I think we might have come to a better solution if we stepped away from the problem and regrouped. Overall, you are a hard worker, and I know it's hard to remove your focus when you are hitting a problem, but taking a walk has been incredibly beneficial for me, and I hope it will be for you too.

## D: Professional Skills
Professional skills are extremely vital to a developer because it allows him to interact with the team he is with, and also allows communication between others. It's easy to replace an engineer, but it's difficult to replace one that works well with his team.

### Gear Up
#### The Gender Gap in Technology

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

The takeaway I got from this Gear Up was surprising. There are many people who judge others for speaking out and against what would be considered the norms for situations. Also, there is something deeper than "Gender Gaps" in the industry, and it becomes annoying when people label it to be politically correct. It made me left thinking more about the root cause of the difference between males and females in this industry.


### Gear Up
#### There's no 'i' in "Team"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

There's no 'i' in Team was a Gear I about working with teams and how they can be successful. The one thing that came up a lot was that teams need to communicate with each other. There hasn't been anything more vital than communication and operating as a team and not just as one person. It left me thinking about why so many people do not want to work with teams and work alone and why they prefer that.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

It was interesting that there isn't enough people trying difficult things that haven't been done. But also, it was cool seeing her away to approaching a problem because usually I just tackle problems head on or be really analytical about things and not in between. It left me thinking about how many different ways there are to tackle difficult things.


### Professional Development Workshops

There are many ways to find jobs, one being networking.

### Reflection

The project management strategies that went well was starting off using waffle and witnessing first hand how difficult is was to be a project manager. I decided on doing it because I had not done it before and wanted to tackle a challenge. My initial strategy went well, but unexpected things happened which resulted in me bringing down the whole team and not contacting the client. I later took control and all of us were able to push through with the help of each other. And I'm glad that it was such a wonderful eye-opening learning experience.

My feedback was initially what I expected since I am almost always aware of my actions. Even if that might have been after something happened. The one thing that I learned that was really important though was that there will always be mistakes made even as a project manager. Also, I was glad that they were able to write about what they felt because it was somewhat of reassurance that I saw that problem if they did as well. I am really glad I got to work with them, but as me and Pat agreed jokingly, if we worked on another long project together, we would have quit Turing.


### Feedback

Throughout Turing, I have made mistakes after mistakes. And I found myself stumbling one after another with everything that kept happening. But I was really happy knowing that Turing staff were always there and supportive to be around. I give props to everyone that I have been able to be around and happy that they helped as I made a commitment to power through no matter what happened. I have no negative feelings towards anyone.

### Values Taken from Posse

The one ironic thing about this section is that I was originally in the Hopper Posse, but it seems to have somewhat disbanded. Even though I wasn't able to join with them as a posse, I was able to help many other people when they needed help. I had the opportunity to help so many people, and help in ways that I felt like the Hopper Posse stood for. Except I was basically a lone wolf helping people as much as I could because I want to see everyone be successful.

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Community Participation**: 4
* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 3

### Notes

* Took feedback from diagnositic and applied to final assessment.
* Changed from 3 to 2 for individual work due to completion, but what he was able to pull off code-wise in a short period of time was really solid.
* Had a hard time with the project management role in The Pivot. Struggled with time management on Rails Engine. Tried to add tests at the end of the project, would like to have him let tests drive the development.
* Really involved in the community. Really appreciate all of your effort to help other students, and the involvement in DSW. It was so helpful to have you talk to incoming potential students. Thank you!
* Tends to converse with people more and take the interactions very seriously. Very receptive to feedback.
* Technically at a good place after this module; however, need to work on project management skills, self-organization, delivering projects, and good workflow on github. 

### Outcome

PASS
