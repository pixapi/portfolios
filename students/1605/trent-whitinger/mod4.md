## Areas of Emphasis
 I set out to learn JavaScript and prepare mentally for the job hunt as well as have a plan of attack for learning interview questions.

 -----------------------
 
 ## A: End of Module Assessment
 
 ### Instructor Comments
- Indentation could be improved in views
- Some confusion about return and conditionals/comparison in javascript
- Backtick strings support multiple lines
- Nice work splitting up files and using es6 features
- Nice test coverage
- Clean UI but it breaks some conventions
### Detailed Rubric
 
 #### 1. Satisfactory Progress
 * **3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5, and one supporting feature, with few bugs and no missing functionality.**
 
 #### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style
 * **3: Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
 
 #### 3. Rails Style & API
 * **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
 
 #### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style
 * **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
 
 #### 5. Testing
 * **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**
 
 #### 6. User Interface
 * **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**
 
 #### 7. Workflow
 * **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**
 
 ## B: Individual Work & Projects
 
 #### Scale Up
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Caleb9193/brotha_nature_api)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)
 
 I was part of the self-driven group "Whiskey Tango" for Scale Up. I learned building a react frontend in a rails app and consuming an API using axios.
 
 #### Idea Box
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/twhitinger/mata)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)
 
 Idea Box is a single-page web app I created with a Rails backend and JavaScript front-end. We had just a few days, I was able to implement all the things.
 I received 140/150 points for Idea Box
 
 ## C: Group Work & Projects
 
 #### Game Time
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/game-time)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
 
 I partnered with Chris for our Game Time project. We built a single-player miniature golf game using the HTML Canvas and JavaScript. By the end of the project, we had a functional game with no major bugs. We were able to enhance gameplay by randomly generating various obstacles. This served as a very valuable lesson in the importance of DRY code and refactoring objects in JavaScript. We used mostly ES6 syntax when creating constructors and assigning properties.
 
  Chris and I received 282/300 points on Game Time
  
 ### Gear Up
 #### Resilience
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)
  -I personally enjoyed this gear up, the mod 1 student in group went off about being paired with a weaker person in their class
 and it brought back memories of our mod and the stress of mod 1.
 
 #### Introversion
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)
 - I think our group generally game to a conclusion that people may have a baseline level of introversion/extroversion and you cant
 let that be an excuse not to take actions that help you bridge the gap or think deeper on issues like introverts/ or be louder
 and charasmatic like extroverts. There are all ways to practice these skills you just have to get out of your comfort zone.
 
 #### Vote Your Conscience
 
 * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)
   - Wow did this backfire
 
 ### Job Search
 #### Priorities
  # Numbers game with applications
 - Right now im focused on jobs in Austin, putting together a short list I was to research more and a large list of just places to submit an application
  # Algorithm and Interview Prep
 - Pracice schedule based on my research of the most common questions and topics to have knowledge of.
 
 #### Current Status
  I have completed 2 code challenges to date. I have many more applications outstanding.I have plans to continue personal projects, on top of just job prep.:
 1. Switch text editor to Vim 
 2. React.js - redo Rails personal project to use React on the front end
 3. Node.js - become proficient with Idea Box and/or URL Lockbox
 4. Learn Elm 
 
 ## E: Feedback and Community Participation
 
 ### Giving Feedback
 
 I gave feedback on many PR's and blog posts as part of Scale Up
 
 ### Being a Community Member
 
 I received much feedback on my Scale Up PR and blog posts
 
 ### Playing a Part
 
 Overall I spent time helping and pairing with other students as I have each Mod. But for Mod 4 I wanted to improve my participation
 on Fridays. But don't take my word for it, heres some quotes. 
 
 Tommasina: 
 
 Since mod 1, Trent has been there for me in difficult moments at Turing. I see him as someone who cares a lot about
 the integrity of his code and his competence as a developer, who shares his time and knowledge freely with other students
 but who doesn't need to be recognized for it, and for whom independence and autonomy are motivating factors in his decision
 to learn programming. I appreciate his sense of humor and comedic timing, and the way he can meet me where I'm at 
 emotionally. I worry that others might not understand him, but I see that he is receptive to constructive feedback, and he
 has been a dedicated member of our cohort. He's been a great friend to me, and I hope that others will see these many 
 endearing traits in him as well.
 
 Casey:
 
 During last mod's screening of 'Debugging the Gender Gap' I was angry to learn that most of my cohort skipped out.
 But you know who didn't skip out that day? Trent. I was also in Trent's group for the Lunch Roulette and Gearup session addressing voting,
 and he  was engaged and made meaningful contributions to our discussions. I know that Trent's been trying to improve his participation 
 in community-related activities, and, as a peer, I can see him doing that, and I appreciate it. It's hard to change habits,
 and it takes courage to undo an identity in front of a large group of people. I'm not sure how other Fridays have gone, but on those two, 
 my experience was richer for having him as a part of this community.
