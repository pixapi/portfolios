# Calaway - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal for Module 2 was to get a solid foundation in the tools and skills necessary for web development. To do this I set out to parlay the coding experience I obtained in Ruby on CLI into Ruby on Rails. While I struggled with the intensity and magnitude of new concepts and information, I worked hard, spent nearly all my waking hours on it, and in spite of a nasty illness in the middle of the module, I ultimately feel I have succeeded.

I have also succeeded in the personal goals I set for myself this module: 1) to eat well, 2) getting enough sleep, 3) keeping my mind open, my attitude positive, and doing my part to keep morale high among my peers in this challenging environment.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The work and projects in Module 2 had a focus on developing the skills needed to build web applications using Ruby and Ruby frameworks, including Sinatra & Rails, with an emphasis on mastering CRUD functionality.

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/calaway/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown)

Robot World was an excellent exercise that we used to learn to use a Ruby framework and to build CRUD functionality.

---

### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/calaway/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

Blogger was used as an introduction to using Rails, pivoting from Sinatra.

---

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/calaway/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master was a very thorough tutorial used to build out complete CRUD functionality in Rails. It also had many side lessons, such as learning to use Heroku and an introduction to APIs.

---

### Rails Mini Project - PointBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/calaway/point_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

This project was used to apply our newly acquired skills of authentication and authorization in preparation for our final project: Little Shop. I unfortunately was very ill over the weekend that we had this assignment, so I did not achieve full functionality. However, I did make sure to study up on the two main skills, mentioned above, that the project was meant to apply. I also went out of my way on my Little Shop team to work directly on all parts involving both of these, so I now have a very solid grasp of them and will feel comfortable applying both on upcoming projects in Module 3.

---

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The team projects this mod were focused on applying and driving home all the skills and knowledge we obtained.

### Rush Hour

* https://github.com/kctrlv/rush-hour
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was a great exercise in the fundamentals of CRUD, SQL (PostgreSQL), and ActiveRecord without using Rails.

#### Evaluation:
* __Functional Expectations: 3__
 * Application fulfills base expectations
* __Test-Driven Development: 3__
 * Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
* __Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3__
 * Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* __Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3__
 * Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* __Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3__
 * Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business
logic.
* __View Layer: 3__
 * Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity
leaking into the view

__Feedback from Ryan:__  
Navigating the traffic jam that is RushHour...  
Calaway, you are a great person to work with, and I would really enjoy pairing with you on another project in the future.  Anytime we had to put our heads down and bust out code, you were more than willing to sit down and figure out the problem.  I really appreciate your ability to speak up and challenge other viewpoints.  You have incredible ideas, and I encourage you to be more vocal to get those ideas across.  Overall, I can say that I will continually bounce ideas off you for the rest of our time at Turing.  Thanks for being an even-keeled, understanding beacon even during the most troubling of storms.

__Feedback from David:__  
Calaway, I feel that our team benefited tremendously from your grounded, level-headed work style. Doing Rush Hour as a three person group was not easy. We did not have the most efficient way to approach it right away, but your input during the three-person-pairing sessions always steered us in the right direction. Pairing with you at union station that day felt very productive and enjoyable. As a small bit of critical feedback, I would love to see you offer your opinion within your team more. It sometimes felt like your voice was the least shared in our group. You are a smart guy, and a pleasure to work with. Thank you for keeping a calm head throughout and having the patience to support the team through to the end, I would love to work with you again.

__My Feedback for Ryan:__  
Ryan, you were awesome to work with on Rush Hour. You have an uncanny ability to see a solution to a problem immediately. At that point you'll often do a code spike to get to that solution quickly. Once you have a good idea you'll bear down and get to the solution with amazing speed and determination. This shows astonishing intelligence and imagination for creative problem solving and should not be discounted.

There are two downsides I see to this methodology. First is that it often lacks a master plan and, while solving the problems, can leave your code without the structure you ultimately want, not as readable as you want, and untested. Second, it can leave your team behind, because while it can make sense when it is explained, it is often not understood until each person has their hands on the keyboard while writing it.

My recommendation would be to continue doing these code spikes, because they're an incredible asset to you and your teams. (Note that I wouldn't recommend this to everybody, but I definitely do for your particular style.) However, I would do it on a separate branch and never merge it into the final code. I would use the spike solely as reference material, and then re-write it with your team from scratch. This way you can go to the whiteboard for the structure, write tests before the code, and have the whole team writing the final code.

We did exactly this during one phase of our project, but there was at least one other time that I wish we would have and didn't. I should have stated this at the time and I'll work on voicing such things in future projects.

Your energy and excitement are contagious. It's fun spending time punching out code with you. You also happen to kick-ass at it. Don't discount your own abilities. Be proud of them.

__My Feedback for David:__  
David, it was awesome working with you on Rush Hour. Your ability to give good structure to your code is something I was able to learn from and improve in my own projects. Your intelligence and problem solving abilities are incredibly impressive and our team benefitted greatly from it.

I do have two small points of actionable constructive criticism, and they tie in to one another. The first is to be more flexible when appropriate, and the second is to pick your battles. I think it is always best that everybody clearly voices their opinion on how to go about an particular problem. Then if there is some disagreement, have an expectation of using your proposed method some portion of the time, and then using an opposing method some other portion of the time. When I saw you being more flexible and concede certain points, then in a later situation when you would 'pick your battle' and stand up for an opposing idea it became much easier to listen to your point very closely and want to agree to go down that path together.

I don't think that you were necessarily bad at either of these points, but I do think it could be beneficial to be aware of them while working on group projects.

You have a great attitude and excitement toward programming and it makes it fun to work on projects together. I appreciated your awesome work ethic and I would consider myself lucky to pair with you again on a later project.

### Little Shop of Orders - Turing Antiques

* https://github.com/bfpepper/little-shop
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop of Orders was the culmination of everything we learned in Module 2. We were able to apply every one of the tools and skills we learned to make a fully functional retail website. Some of the highlights for me were working in agile phases with a client, putting all our newly acquired skills together, and practicing acting as project manager for our team.

__Feedback from Ben:__  
Calaway was a a fantastic project manager for Little Shop. His attention to detail and ability to delegate tasks was instrumental in our success in the project. His drive to understand the problem and to tackle whatever needed to be dealt with shows a deep desire to learn everything he can from his time at Turing. Calaway was persistent in making sure everyone in out group touched every aspect of the project. This was invaluable. I tend to shy away from tasks like styling and knowing I would have to do it was daunting but also made me think far more about it then I would have normally. One area I would suggest for improvement is styling. We are back end. It is important to know how to style but some basic bootstrap here and there is all we really need.

__Feedback from Nate:__  
Calaway was a great partner in Little Shop. He took on the role as project manager and kept us thoroughly organized and on task throughout the duration of the project. He always pushed himself to full understanding and would break everything down into smaller parts to see how everything fit together. The only thing I would say is sometimes he maybe gets a little too hung up on these smaller details, but that is nitpicking in a lot of ways. I really appreciate his contributions to the project and would be happy to work with him again.

__Feedback from Brendan:__  
I worked with Calaway on our Little Shop project. Calaway has a really good sense for what a quality project should look like and keeping the group to a vision. Calaway acted as project manager on Little Shop, and did a fantastic job at keeping our goals straight and agile. While the rest of us struggled to get into the flow of communicating via GitHub, Calaway held us to it until we kept to it as a group. Even outside of his project manager role, though, Calaway was really thoughtful about the design of the project and keeping our code clean.

__My Feedback for Ben:__  
Ben has been a great asset to our Little Shop project. When he sets to work he is able to work quickly and efficiently toward a solution. He is very knowledgable of the material and is an excellent resource to go to with any questions. He has an awesome way of explaining concepts that you might not understand. He is also great at keeping spirits up with his sharp with and sense of humor.

__My Feedback for Nate:__  
Nate has been a great asset to our group on our Little Shop project. His communication has been excellent, which was apparent from the initial DTR. He has a good gauge of his own abilities and knows where he can have the most impact on getting the project done and helping the rest of us understand it. His knowledge of the material is very evident when working with him and his ability to learn new concepts quickly and apply them immediately is impressive. I would consider myself lucky to pair with him on any other projects in the future.

__My Feedback for Brendan:__  
Brendon has been an amazing asset to our Little Shop team. His grasp of the material and ability to quickly learn and internalize new concepts is second to none. His communication is concise and clear, and while he doesn't always make his thoughts known as frequently as others might, he knows when it's important to contribute ideas and they are always well received when he offers them. I feel like I've already learned a lot by pairing with him and would certainly enjoy working on any other project together in the future.

## D: Professional Skills

Professional development at Turing is intended to prepare us for entering the workforce in our new careers as Software Developers.

---

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

I thoroughly enjoyed this Gear Up session. It had a good amount of research based ideas regarding how humans can optimize their learning. It reflected much of the type of research and ideas as one of my favorite behavioral psychology books "Thinking, Fast & Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. One exceptional takeaway is that we can potentially learn things very quickly by intense repetition, which is certainly a technique we can apply to software development at Turing and beyond.

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This Gear Up session was about working in teams. I appreciate this type of lesson since we will frequently be working in teams throughout our career and in many other arenas in life. However, I think the focus of the lesson was misplaced. The speaker in the video made many assertions on which no attempt was made to back them up with empirical evidence. The exercise was in vulnerability with randomly assigned groups, which I think missed the mark if the purpose was to help us work well on team projects.

#### CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This session was very important to me. One reason I chose Turing over other schools is because of their commitment to social justice. As a person existing in the demographic majority, one thing I've had a goal of taking away from my time here is how I can contribute toward making the software development field a more equitable place to work. This Gear Up session was very valuable to me in advancing this aspiration.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/calaway/0dae1a883c391e0c99241a92603144d5)

This session was used to give us advice of how to build our personal brand and online presence.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
 * One excellent experience for me during our team projects this module is that I got the opportunity to act as project manager for Little Shop. I first approached my teammates in our initial DTR to ask them how I can best add value in that role. With that feedback I had two goals: 1) to not tell people what to do at any time, and 2) to take the work of planning of of their plates so they can focus on writing code. I would prepare before our periodic Agile Stand Ups to let them know where we are, where we need to go, and then as a group we would discuss and decide how to get there.
2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
  * One of the best takeaways for me was how to act as an effective project manager. It's all about listening to what the team needs and then prepare that and guide discussions and decision making appropriately with that information.

#### Networking with Lia

This session was to help us know how to get the most out of networking opportunities. I'll use what I learned in this to approach networking with an honest curiosity and a good attitude. Don't go into the situation looking for a job offer. Go in looking to meet good people in the software development community and enjoy yourself. Follow up as appropriate and let them know you have an interest in good positions when they arise.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

*(Please see the project section above for project specific feedback)*

__My Feedback for Jasmin Hudacsek:__  
From day one Jasmin has been, and continues to be, an incredible asset to our cohort. She has a keen mind for organization and a desire to go above and beyond to share that and her other talents with her peers. She will commonly be the person we all go to to help organize our own calendars and to do lists through the endless tangle of projects and assignments here at Turing. Additionally, her intelligence and ability to quickly pick up and internalize the material is very impressive, and her willingness to use her knowledge to help others has been an amazing help to us all. She also is wonderful at keeping a positive attitude and using her energy to keep morale high, especially during the most stressful times when we all need it the most.

### Being a Community Member

*(Please see the project section above for project specific feedback)*

### Playing a Part

This module I have been proud to immerse myself in the Turing Community in multiple ways:
 * I took over the job of setting up and organizing the Mod 2 => Mod 1 pairing sessions. I appreciated this program so much when I myself was in Mod 1 that I sought out the previous person in charge of this to actively volunteer for the position. I improved it in several ways including offering more available time slots, improving the sign up spreadsheet (with Jesse's assistance), and offering much more detailed information to the new cohort at the onset of the new module. This experience has been very personally fulfilling to me and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to pay the favor forward to the next generation of students.
 * I have volunteered as a prework mentor and have been actively working with the mentee assigned to me to answer any of his questions and have him up to speed for the beginning of his Turing journey.
 * I joined and have been an active participant in the Armstrong posse. I love our meetings in part because we have no specialists in the field of machine learning that we are studying, which means that we are all learning it and teaching it to each other together.
 * In addition to these things I make a great effort to keep a positive attitude and stay in good spirits from day to day, especially during the most stressful times. It is easy for students to fall into despair in such an intense and demanding environment and I feel that it is our very important responsibility to do our part to lookout for our fellow students' and keep morale high. It may seem like a small contribution, but if you ask my cohort they will tell you that I'll rarely spread any negative sentiment and always do my best to be uplifting and positive.
