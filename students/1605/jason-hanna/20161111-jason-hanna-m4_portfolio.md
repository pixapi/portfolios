# Jason Hanna - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I would like to really dive into Javascript and have at least a working understanding of it. I would also like to learn at least one of the frameworks for it.

###### Description:

URLockbox is a project part of the final assessment for Module 4 students at
Turing School. The goal is to implement a CRUD Rails app with authentication
and responsive JavaScript. This app uses JavaScript and jQuery on the front
end, with a Rails API serving up the content on the backend. My main focus here
was implementing all CRUD functionality with a Rails API, and learning about
using the fetch API to make authenticated API requests.



## Detailed Rubric
#### Notes

- Clear UI with good instructions for use
- Alphabetize and filter javascript is clean
- Test coverage is good. Some sad paths, but some features are not covered.

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:


Evaluator: Nate

1. Satisfactory Progress: 3
1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3
1. Rails Style & API: 3
1. JavaScript Syntax & Style: 3
1. Testing: 3
1. User Interface: 3

***Total: 175/175 points***

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Ideabox 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/idea-box-2.0)
* [Production URL](https://idea-box-2-the-reckoning.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

This project was an exercise in building a single page CRUD application with JavaScript. It's a Rails application for the back end database, and uses jQuery and AJAX for the front end. This project was my first experience writing a JavaScript-focused application with heavy DOM manipulation using jQuery.

***Score: 118/150***


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Gametime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/gametime)
* [Production URL](https://automatic365.github.io/gametime/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This project was done by me and Lane Winham as our final paired project at Turing School. When the project was assigned, we had a few months of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and one week of JavaScript experience. The goal of the project was to either create an original or recreate a 2d style game in HTML5 canvas.

**Scores**
- **Check-In 1: 50/50**
- **Check-In 2: 60/50**
- **Check-In 3: 55/50**
- **Evaluation: 122/150**
- **Total:      287/300**

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL - LookingFor Front End](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd)
* [GitHub URL - LookingFor Back End](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingfor)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/looking_for_project.markdown)

During Scale Up I dove into an open source project called 'Looking-For' that has been worked on for multiple cohorts at Turing. The application is a job posting website that pulls in technical job postings from several aggregators including stackoverflow.com and weworkremotely.com. The app has a Rails API on the back end, and React on the front end. I worked on the front end React application during the two-week project.

The majority of my work prior to tackling issues was spent learning React and becoming comfortable with the code base. My main contribution to the project was working on was adding a mailer to the backend application, and starting progress on adding referral via email on the front end. In addition, I wrote a blog post documenting my experience learning React.

Scores
- **Week 1: 125/150**
- **Week 2: 120/150**
- **Total:  245/300**

## Community

### Giving Feedback
**To Lane:**
Lane was a great partner to work with for Game Time. He was extremely easy to work with, and always willing to give me space to experiment with the code. He also has a tenacity about going in a certain direction and finding the most efficient or succinct solution, which really helped us break through some real challenging spots. I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to work with Lane on another project. I always have confidence in his work being done completely, thoroughly, and creatively.


### Being a Community Member

**From Lane**

Jason was a tireless worker and great leader on the project. He kept me focused and really drove the development process.He was instrumental on really making the final push of this project, and his thoughtful observations were great for making sure I understood what was happening at all times.



### Playing a Part
* I was in Lindow posse.  As part of that, I worked on job preparation.
* I am an SAB Representative, and participated in all meetings and led Retros.
* I sought to be an active and engaged participant in professional development, Friday Spikes and GearUps.

## Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I really liked this session. I think reminding everyone that it is not only a privilege but a right that you should exercise is a great thing. I also liked that we had lunch with the group first.

#### Introversion/Extroversion on Teams
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I enjoyed this session. Taking the time to really understand introversion, and the unique qualities that introverts can bring to a team is very important. After reading through the materials, I think I register as an ambivert.

#### Resilience
[Markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I thoroughly enjoyed this session. I feel that this is a session all module one students should experience. I think resilience is the opposite of entitlement, and requires a lot of mindfulness. Turing tests this quality more than any other experience I've ever had, so it is worthwhile to explore.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Exercise Follow Up
[Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

Important to me:

* Environment I will be working within
* People I will be working with

* Don't give information about companies to anyone else

* Be quick to communicate with other companies once you receive an offer

#### Job Shadowing

My takeaways:
* I would like to work at a small, but established company

* The codebase might be bigger but it is all things we have covered at Turing

* Hiring managers understand the situation I am in and will knowingly hire me with the expectation that I will need some help.

#### Blog Posts
[Lesson Plan](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/writing_a_blog_post_and_peer_review.md)

[My Week with React: A Love Story](https://medium.com/@TheJasonHanna/my-week-with-react-a-love-story-1a3ac169a10f#.9m9585izs)

My takeaways:
