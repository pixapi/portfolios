# Chase Dunagan - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod, I wanted to put everything I've learned at Turing, together.  I wanted to put my rails skills together with my ruby skills and create some cool webapps.  I wanted to get better with my SQL and Active Record queries, and I wanted to polish my skills, to the point where I would be comfortable looking for a job in mod 4, with the knowldege that I could do this and that I would be successful at it.

#### Notes from Josh

Took several risks:

Google-cloud storage
Handrolling Twilio without Authy
Used Fabricator over Factory girl to try and get familiar with a new process
We split the user tables to be closer to normal form instead of keeping
Really solid project especially in terms of the technical challenges taken.

(Feedback from team)

### From Jesse:
You did a great job with a lot of the technical challenges you took on. Specifically, you hand rolled the twilio text message service and setup a lot of the photo crud on your own. You brought a positive energy to everything you worked on and I wish we had gotten to pair more than we did. Another thing that I respect about your work on this project was in our original DTR conversation where you brought up concerns you had about working with me. That took guts. You framed everything you were thinking in a positive, humorous way so it was easy for me to hear what you were saying. In terms of an area of growth, I would challenge you to be more disciplined with your work. For example, when we were working over the weekend, announcing fantasy football scores gave me the impression that you weren't entirely checked in. Overall, it was great having you on the team thanks to your humor, honesty, and the technical chops you brought to bear on some of the most challenging parts of the project.

### From Calaway:
Chase has been awesome to work with. His knowledge of the material and excellent methods of researching any technical aspects that he didn’t yet know kept us continually moving forward on even the most difficult aspects of the project.

### From Dan:
You did a good job pairing on the api with me and making sure we were both working on the same page and also taking turns driving because you have good self awareness, but you could make sure you don’t spend to much time on the same problem in order to get the most out of your time.

Feedback to team) 

### To Jesse:
Jesse teaches you why tests and organization can be vital to a well run project. I loved how he pushed us constantly to be better programmers. My only critique of Jesse is that he can be really hard on himself sometimes. He thinks the group might be judging him if he isn't working hard enough, and I don't think that is ever the case.

### To Calaway:
Calaway was an excellent team leader. He made decisions that would appeal to the group as whole and always put the group ahead of himself. As a pairing partner, he was great to work with and always kept his spirits high. One critique I would give to Calaway, is to not be afraid of trying stuff. Sometimes he would hesitate instead of just going for it. Code is free. Be a daredevil!

### To Dan:
Dan was great to work with. He is smart and knows how to research ideas he isn't sure about. One critique I would give to Dan is that he sometimes gets so into his code, that he tunes out the rest of the world, including the words of his team members. This is never for very long, and it's obvious he doesn't mean to, but it's still something he could try working on.

## D: Something valuable I've taken away from my posse

I joined Miyamoto this mod, and I think it was a great decision.  They are fearless when it comes to learning new languages, and new code, in oder to make games.  And I feel like that mentality is something that would be great for me to have. I still don't have that mentality yet, but I'm hoping I will get it soon.  They worked very hard every week to try new things and learn new fun ways of playing/making games, and I'm very glad I joined such a fun and hardworking Posse. 

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up 

#### Vote your Conscious

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This gear up was fun because we got to read a couple of articles that made me think and reevaluate how I feel about voting or not voting during an election.  The discussions were short, but that made them have to be pertinent, in order to get our points across.  It was a good gear up.

#### Introvert & Extrovert Introspection

This gear up was great because we were able to have it within our own cohort.  We talked about introverts and extroverts and I learned more about a couple of introverts in my class, and realized how working in groups was a much much different experience for them, than it was for me. I made me rethink how I should treat and accept people during group work, because of the way they might be feeling about it, if they are an introvert. 

#### Resilience

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

This gearup really solidified a term that I never really related to my life.  In my life I have been very resilient, but I never knew that's what it was.  Now, I know what it is, and me and my group talked about techniques to be more resilient in my every day life.
