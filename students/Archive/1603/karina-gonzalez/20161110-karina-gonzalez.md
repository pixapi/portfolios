### Areas of Emphasis

Turing has helped me grow in so many ways.  I came to Turing intimidated by code and questioning my ability to learn how to write it. However, although coding was not easy, the area of growth that has strained, humbled, and mattered the most has been _time_ -- and my ability, or lack thereof, to manage it. My goal for myself regarding this module was to get a better grip on my organizational skills. This time-management problem has been a burden since elementary school and I fear it will -- _I_ will cheat myself out of even those opportunities which incite passion within me. Not being able to fully trust yourself with your own future, that's frightening and humiliating. I can honestly say that, even though it may not seem like it, I have made progress the last couple of weeks.  More progress than I have made, regarding this aspect of myself, my whole life-- I maintain a google calendar!  It's the small victories that matter when attempting to pull a complete 360 on your personal habits. To be frank, I feel I need the help of a therapist to address the root of the problem before effectively improving the surface of it. I'm grateful to Turing for helping me grow instead of letting me go.  I'm doing my best trying to not let you guys, my community back home, and myself down.

#### Mock/Final Assessment

* [Production](https://urlockboxx.herokuapp.com/)

It was great to be comfortable enough with CSS to put together a good looking site that also functions well.

**Andrew evaluated this project with the following results:**

Notes:

* functionality in place works very well
* Missing iteration 5 and supporting feature
* Code in place looked really good - just not fully complete.


* Developer had finished code for at least through iteration 5 but it was not on production because it was finished past the deadline. The javascript score would have also been higher with all features implemented.

## Team

**From Tommasina and Deb GameTime teammate:**

T: Karina was one of my partners during GameTime. She was able to take several complicated components on her own--for example, the score board which hosted scores persisted in local storage in the browser--so that we could make faster progress. She also helped our group integrate stubbing into our test suite, something we had no previous experience doing in Mocha/Chai. I see in Karina an authenticity and a joie de vivre that seem rare. She has been challenging herself to meet deadlines, something that doesn't always happen for her, I think because of the way she maintains presence in what she is doing. I only hope that adjusting her sense of time doesn't crush some of the creative flights she takes when given extra time. I've been so happy to get to know her through our beloved Pahlka Posse. I look forward to seeing what lucky organization will get to harness some of her coding magic.

D: Karina can crush some code. She is uniquely skilled at vocalizing what she is doing while coding and is a great pair. I really enjoyed working with her on Game Time. She has a great flexibility to work as a group or independently and is able to analyze and solve problems in the code and keep a project moving forward. I often see her helping people from other modules and volunteering her time and energy to community events and causes. My one worry is that she will spread herself across too many things, but I know she is working on how to stop saying yes to everything and balance her energy and time. She is also an uncommon and beautiful butterfly of friend.

**from mentor July**

I've had the pleasure of being Karina's mentor and working with her in Pahlka Posse. She has so much potential that I am excited to see her grow into. Karina is technically talented and has an uplifting personality. Her passion for improving her community around her is evident, and it flows into the hearts of those around her. I am so proud of her organization of a volunteer group helping out at the Boys & Girls club. My hope for her is that she can overcome her self-doubt and develop skills in organization and time management to be a consistently reliable community member who can be held accountable for her commitments. Once she can exercise these skills consistently and confidently and learns more about the issues facing our communities, I see her becoming a truly galvanizing leader, and I am super excited to see that day.

**From Chaz**

I've Karina to thank for introducing me to Pahlka Posse, and the existence of "Civic Tech" - in a way our interactions have always guided me in the right direction. It was through Karina that I was able to begin to pursue a passion of teaching the youth to code, via her volunteer work at the Boys & Girls Club. Over the course of three-months I've witnessed her grow outwardly in the community through her work with Pahlka Posse, but also inwardly in regard to her confidence in her programming. Whether it was testing a buggy app, or ensuring people showed up for volunteer work, Karina has shown me the dedication and discipline it takes to be an active member of the "Turing Community".
