# Sonia Gupta - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module emphasized working on a brownfield project, which taught me a lot about managing expectations, sifting through old code, and the art of refactoring. Towards the end of this module I began focusing on learning Python and building simple applications with it.

  * [Staging Website](enroll-staging.turing.io)
  * [Scores](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1606-b/enroll)

  **Feedback To Jean Joeris:** "Jean has been an exceptional team leader. While he seemed a little unsure of his role at the beginning of the project, he certainly made up for that by the end. He became more engaged in the project and with working with fellow team members, and he did excellent work on the search feature. Jean has an innate talent for managing the expectations of others in a fruitful and compassionate way. It was truly a pleasure to be on a team with him."

  **Feedback From Jean Joeris:** "Sonia has been an excellent team member. She took on the  DevOps and rocked it. When unexpected deployment issues came up she was ready to address, even when she had other work to do. Her willingness to give me frank and direct feedback about my product management was extremely helpful. She was also collaborated well with Matt on Dashboard. I'm very glad I got to work with Sonia"

  **Feedback to Raphael Barbo:** "I think Rapha and I would both agree that we've learned a lot from each other about our own working and communication styles. He is the consummate professional, and I appreciate that he has been receptive to feedback. He brings a gentle positivity to every endeavor, and has put in a lot of effort on this project. I'm glad to know him, and have learned a lot about how I can improve myself not only as a programmer, but as a human."

  **Feedback from Raphael Barbo:** "I can certainly say that having Sonia in the Enroll throughout the module has been such a treat to all of us. She adds more than just knowledge to the group and it is always refreshing to hear her point of views about some of the logical problems we were going through during the project. Sonia and I have paired quite a few times throughout our time at Turing, and I can certainly say that we have overcome quite a few hurdles (mainly due to our personalities) and this willingness that we both bring to the table, to always work together and improve ourselves for the sake of becoming a better human being and professional, has definitely brought us closer this module.
  I know she will go great things in the future, and I can't wait to see what her coding life takes her."

  **Feedback to Brian Heim:** "Brian has been the person I worked with most on this project, and every moment was truly a pleasure. Even when we were frustrated, I always felt we were in it together. I had never worked with Brian before this project, and I am truly lucky to now have had the opportunity to do so. Brian has patience, resilience, and an incredibly upbeat personality. He allowed me to explore potential solutions even if they didn't work, and he never talked down to me. He treated me as an equal, and was incredibly respectful and compassionate. I learned from him how to have a sense of humor about our frustrations, and he kept me optimistic even when I felt downtrodden. I'm really grateful to Brian for his kindness and camaraderie. It means more than I can say. :)"

  **Feedback from Brian Heim:** "This was my first time working with Sonia and it was a great experience. We ended up serving as the ‘DevOps’ team for our project and paired on most tasks. This was a new field of study for us and thus we were learning as we went. Working with a brownfield project as well as a totally new technology is quite challenging but Sonia and I were persistent and came away with alot of new knowledge. Sonia is a pleasure to pair with, she is very conscientious and seeks collaboration both when driving and navigating. She also kept a strong set of notes with useful commands and processes so that when we needed to revisit things, we did not have to waste time searching for solutions that we had already discovered. Sonia is also a strong programmer technically, and I feel we worked well as a team and complimented each other in terms of technical knowledge and skill; it always felt as though we were on “the same page”. My only advice to Sonia would be to put more trust in her intuition. There were times where she would second guess herself, but more often than not, her instincts were right. Sonia was awesome to work with and even though we worked on the most mystifying and at times frustrating portion of the project, we emerged successful and I am excited to see what Sonia can accomplish once we leave Turing."

  **Feedback to David Davydov:** "David and I have worked together before, and it was a pleasure to work with him again on exposing the API endpoint. David is methodical and enthusiastic about coding. He was patient and respectful, and I appreciate his considerable skill. David has become an incredibly strong developer during his time at Turing, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to learn with him."

  **Feedback from David Davydov:** "Sonia has become a strong and capable developer during her time at Turing. Sonia was integral to getting Enroll operational as she handled the DevOps portion. This was not easy, as there were two brownfield apps that talked to each other with unusual interconnections. Sonia is honest with her team mates about how she feels and when things are not right with her, but it was always good to have that conversation with her. We collaborated together on the Dashboard and opened up an API endpoint for Matt on the front-end. Sonia, I know you're going to be a strong force wherever you go. Keep your spirits high, and inspire others to be their best selves. I've learned a lot from working with you."

#### Open Source (With Calaway)
  * [Pull Request (includes Code contribution and Documentation contribution)](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/1179)
  * [Bug Refutation](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/1166)

  **Feedback to Calaway:** "I had never had the chance to work with Calaway before the open source project, and I'm so glad I didn't leave Turing without having that opportunity. It was truly one of the most pleasant, encouraging, and fun pairing experiences I have ever had.

  Calaway approaches problems with precision and patience. In our personal interactions, Calaway has always proven himself to be incredibly kind, conscientious, and mindful. These traits were also evident in our pairing interaction.

  When initially confronting a problem, Calaway makes sure to explain what he is thinking, and where he is in the code. I never felt like I wasn't following, because he made himself extremely clear, and was very patient in his explanations. He also showed me a number of shortcuts that I had never used before (clicking on the path to copy in Atom? Mind-blowing!). His passion for coding really comes through when he is digging through a difficult issue, such as when we were trying to set up the virtual environment for our first attempt at open source contribution. He is persistent, but knows how to manage his time well and doesn't just aimlessly run down rabbit holes. Instead, Calaway methodically reviews each possible point of failure and tests them. His precision is truly a joy to observe. Watching Calaway solve a problem is a great way to find out if you yourself truly love coding; if you feel excitement and intrigue when working with him, the answer is probably yes!

  On a personal level, I have been so honored to know and learn with Calaway. He is truly one of the kindest, most well-balanced individuals I have ever known. I aspire to be more like him in so many ways. He always seems to be the voice of reason when those around him are falling apart, and he takes a very equitable view of problems and does not lose focus of the really important issues involved. I have said this of very few people I have known throughout my journey on this planet, but I am a better person for knowing Calaway, and I honestly hope we will be friends for life."

  **Feedback from Calaway:** "One regret I thought I would be walking away from Turing with was not getting the opportunity to work on a project with Sonia. Lucky for me we were given one last chance to pair up with a classmate in the form of our first open source contribution. It is easy to see from working with Sonia that her natural intelligence coupled with her impressive education and experience have given her an excellent way of approaching and solving problems. Her excited explanations upon first understanding how the code base we were working on functions made the joy of writing code infectious. After working with her I can confidently say that her well developed soft skills—such as excellent communication and admirable drive—are in every way matched by her technical ability to write great software.

  Sonia has an excellent style of teamwork, such that the cooperative effort is greater than the sum of what would be possible from the individuals separately. Related to this but on a personal note, at the end of my first week here at Turing, which was also my first week living in Colorado, I was invited to hang out with a few of the Mod 2 cohort for a bit after school. Sonia was incredibly warm and inviting and helped me instantly feel at home in what could have otherwise felt like a lonely and foreign environment. Since then I have seen this welcoming and community building behavior from her toward many other students. She is a person who can make a cohort feel like a family, and I consider myself lucky to be able to call her a friend."

## D: Professional Skills

#### Top 3 Priorities in The Job Search and Why:

1) **Located in Denver:** During my time at Turing, I have come to love Denver. I want to remain here because it feels like I have found a home, and also because I love the Turing family and want to remain an active part of it.  

2) **Mid-to-large Company:** I think I will probably find more stability and job security at a mid-to-large company. They will likely have more technical procedures in place as well as more benefits. I also like the idea of being able to be around more programmers rather than less, and working regular hours without being expected to be on call.

3) **Easily Accessible Mentorship and Continued Learning:** This relates to the company size priority listed above, but seeing as I will be entering the workforce as a junior developer, I believe I will benefit most from having access to mentors and other programmers to learn the ropes. I also want to be at a company that encourages my continued learning through an educational stipend or other means.


#### Action Plan to Overcome Perceived Barriers to The Job Search:

I think my biggest problem will be maintaining my own confidence level. The best way for me to combat this is to just keep coding. So I will be at Turing every day that I don't have a job, and I will be coding ever day as if I'm in school. That will help me to feel like I can stay competitive.

I also really enjoy just getting to know people in the tech community, so going to meetups and remaining active on Twitter will help people warm up to me, which makes it easier for me to approach them. I've even joined a book club with some tech folks in Boulder and am looking forward to getting to know them better.

Maintaining by self-branding will also be crucial in this. I published my first blog post today and it has already been retweeted by someone in the community. I suspect that continuing to publish will give me more exposure and make me more comfortable with discussing technical topics.

#### Six cold outreach emails sent:

In the interest of not publicizing the identities of the individuals to whom I sent these emails, I would rather not post their information here. However, I did promptly message Lia and Meg with the information pertaining to both batches of cold outreach emails (3 emails in each batch).

#### Blog Post and Peer Review

***Feedback from Calaway:***

"A very well put together piece of writing, indeed! This manages to be at once informative and entertaining, which is certainly a difficult balance to strike. The personal narrative through the difficulties and successes, as well as the expert literary style, make the piece highly readable. I’ve been meaning to tell you that I always appreciate and admire your vocabulary. It brings a distinguished kind of spice to conversations you’re in, while still being inviting and approachable, and I can now see that such vernacular translates well into written form as well.
I do have one minor technical suggestion. I always like when technical explanations include the path and filename of each file they’re referencing as a comment on the first line of the code snippet for increased clarity.
Very well done. I hope this finds it’s way into the hands of a student struggling with the dreaded CORS issues as we all have this module!"

***Feedback from Susi Irwin:***

"Overall Impressions: Well thought out and flows wonderfully! I love the use of your humor in there to guide the reader through a super complicated project and set of problems.

Structure & Formatting - Well done! Love the code snippets and information from the Heroku's site. Easy to read, and easy to follow.

Grammar & Syntax - I don't see anything to update here at all.

This is a wonderful post! I hope you continue writing - so interesting to read and learn from you :) Well done, Sonia!!"

***Feedback from Jasmin Hudacsek:***

###### Is the topic clear to you from the first few sentences? Does the writer clearly describe the topic?
The topic recounts a personal programming experience Sonia had with CORS and Heroku on a brownfield application. I feel that she stayed on topic throughout her post.

###### Does the title fit the post?
Yes.

###### Is it clear who the audience is for this post?
The audience sounds like it's for anyone who has experienced DevOps issues, especially as a newer developer.

###### Do you have a sense of who the author is from the writing?
Because I know Sonia pretty well, I do feel like the way she communicates in person comes through in her writing here.

###### Structure & Formatting

###### Is there a clear beginning, middle, and end?
Sonia introduced a scenario she encountered, talked about how they figured out the issue, and relayed the information so someone could theoretically use it to solve their own Heroku woes. I'd say it does have good progression from beginnging, middle and end.

###### Are code snippets or other screenshots incorporated when necessary?
Yes.

###### Is the language clear? How could it be tightened?
I think the language is great--doesn't need tightening.

###### Are there run-on sentences?
Nope, all of her sentences are short and to the point.

###### Is punctuation consistent throughout the post?
Yes.

###### Do sentences use active voice and avoid cliches?
There is at least one cliche (`... won’t be out of the woods yet... `) and a couple of 'so's', overall I'd say she kept it active.

###### Does the vocabulary level fit the topic and audience?
Yes.

###### Final Words

###### What would make you click on this post if you saw it on Medium?
Possibly a nice cover photo as a opposed to a screenshot as the first image.

###### What are three things that would make this post more engaging?
Some URLs to click on would be nice, like a link to Turing School or to the repositories for Enroll or Apply (if they're not private). Also, breaking up some of the paragraphs by bolding key points or could make portions of the post a lot more Tweet-able. (Ex. 'Lesson: Read docs carefully! You never know what will end up being a roadblock. Understand your hosting service, and make sure you follow their rules.' <-- Awesome, just make it stand out even more and put it on its own line)

###### What is one idea that could be edited out of this post?
It was overall pretty succinct. I wouldn't remove any idea.

## F: Gear Up

I was excused from attending the first GearUp because I went to S300 to assist with the session for Mod 1. I decided to work along with their curriculum on Grit, and I found it very useful to address the topic at the beginning of Module 4. I was excused from the second GearUp to attend a lunch meeting at Return Path.

I attended the final GearUp, again on Grit, and was glad to revisit the topic. Grit is something I needed to get through Mod 4, and I will continue to need it as I press on in my new career. This is just the beginning of my journey.

## G: Community

This module I continued the tradition of cleaning out the fridges every Friday. I participated in Try Turing on a couple of occasions, and offered emotional support to struggling Mod 1 students (I know what it's like to be in their shoes). I also paired with Mod 1 students throughout the module. I gave a lightning talk on the Fourth Amendment and Electronic Privacy on the last Friday of the module.
