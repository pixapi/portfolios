## Name: Susi Irwin

### Goals Assignment:
 1. Informational Interviews - Since I have a job, I do not plan on meeting with people to actively pursue a job. I will meet people through my community involvement.

2. [Blog Post - Open Source Blog for Faker Gem Contribution](https://medium.com/@susi27/fake-it-til-you-eat-your-dessert-a43aec0a4b4b#.kgrgijgad) - Work in Progress

### Personal Goals:
 1. JavaScript - I am a beginner at JavaScript right now, but my new role at Granicus is that of a Full Stack Engineer so i will need to get MUCH more comfortable with it. My goal over the next 10 days in between graduation and starting work is to complete the JavaScript lessons in the Front End Site and to work on the JavaSript Playground which we have already started during this Module. Success in this is being more confident and comfortable in my ability to read, understand, and compose code. I will recreate Idea Box and also take on Mythical Creatures in JavaScript as part of my success measure.

 2. Open Source - I want to be actively contributing to a project by the end of March. My goal is to complete at least 2 decently sized PRs to a single project that I can really sink my teeth into. Ultimate mark of success will be to have my PRs merged. The project that I am most intrigued with right now is Growstuff.org since my husband, son, and sister-in-law all love to garden. This would be a great way for me to bridge that interest gap.

 3. Family-Friendly - My personal project from Module 3 is one that I am extremely proud of and do not want to leave behind. There are so many opportunities for me to improve upon it. The first goal with this is to upgrade the APi from Yelp v2 to v3. Once that is done and tests are all passing (success point 1) I plan to add React in and see if I can update the index page to use React components. Once that is working (success point 2), I will do the same for the Business Show page.

### Which Assignments and Why?

1. Community Involvement - I would like to start attending the Ruby meetups in either Denver or Boulder once I get my bearings at Granicus. I think I will always have a soft spot for Ruby since it was my first language and would love to stay in the community to keep my skills up. Since Turing took up all of my time outside of my family, I was not able to attend meetups while attending school; this needs to change as soon as I am out! So far I have really enjoyed playing with React so I would like to attend that meetup as well. Conferences feel like a pipedream right now as I don't know how that works with work, but Ruby Conference is on my list for sure. I also would like ot attend some start up week events this year as well. I do really enjoy the social aspect of coding and want to be more involved with that. I also plan to stay tightly connected to Turing and the Joan Clarke Society. I ahve a single published blog post, but 2 in draft in Medium. I think it would be fun to get that blog moving especially as i start this new career.

2. Side Hustle -

   Project 1: Podcast Tracker

        MVP: React App to track Name, URL, Description, and address of Podcasts to listen to while commuting.

        Future Iterations: Rating System, Feed of podcasts that auto-updates

        Why? Stay up on current topics and technology; make good use of my commute time to and from work

        Staying on Track: Waffle

        Pairing/Parterning: Not so much on this one at least to start - challenge myself to learn independently but reach out on Slack channels for help and advice

        Get the word out: Tweet when I am ready

    Project 2: Hour Tracker

        MVP: Simple Table in a Rails app that would store Sam's client names and contact info, total hours allocated, and then count against those hours as he bills

        Future Iterations: reporting features, tie in to his financial billing

        Why? I want to help my husband track his client hours and non-billable hours.

        Staying on Track: Waffle

        Pairing/Partnering: My husband would be my main partner on this as a business user to help me figure out requirements and do testing since the app is for him.

      Project 3: Household Planner

          MVP: An App (Rails, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax?) that helps us manage our household. Links to Google Calendar for easy tracking. Options for chores, errands, meetings outside of the house, and activities for our son.

          Future Iterations: reporting features, tie in to financial budget, send invites to the app from calendar (and vice versa), ability to send text alerts when someone adds a task

          Why? We are a busy family with a super active Toddler. It would be amazing to keep us more in sync and I think it would be fun to make another Family-centered app.

          Staying on Track: Waffle

          Pairing/Partnering: My husband would be my main partner on this app as well. I would need his feedback and input, but I will also want a technical partner to bounce ideas off of and check my code. I think it would be fun to work with my Mentor on this as he and his family may also benefit from this and getting his input would be fantastic.
