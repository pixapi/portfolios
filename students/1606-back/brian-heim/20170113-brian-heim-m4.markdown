# Brian Heim - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Mod 4, it seemed so long ago that I was in mod 1 and yet it seems like it was yesterday. I wanted to really work hard this mod and to finish strong. Little did I know just how hard we would be working, but I wouldn't change it for a thing. Our mod has been told many times how "resilient" and "performant" we are and I think we stepped up to the challenge in mod 4 and backed up both of those statements. 

My specific personal goals for this mod were pretty straight forward. I wanted to pass the final, learn JavaScript, and make strides in the job search. I successfully passed the final, learned vanilla JS and some React, and made some good progress in my search for a job. I was very happy to have achieved all of these things during this module. I would have liked to have spent more time job hunting, but I did have some very helpful informational interviews, improved my resume, LinkedIn, and GitHub, and made some new professional connections. 

Something that I didn't necessarily set as a goal in the beginning of the mod, but I am glad to have worked on was the six-week brownfield project in a sprint style environment. I have been told over and over in informational interviews and meetUps that working on a project of that caliber is incredibly relevant to a real-life dev job. DevOps quickly became a focus of the module for me as well; once I took on that task with Sonia, there was no turning back. While frustrating at times, learning about and performing DevOps tasks was truly rewarding and definitely added value to my experience at Turing.

I am very proud not only of my work during the past six weeks of class, but of the last seven months as a whole.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This section contains individually completed work using the React library. More in the Capstone Project section.

### React work

Learning React has been really fun. I am excited to keep working with it, especially on the Turing Dashboard app. I think React is a very effective way to render alot of different pages with different content and functionality very easily. When combined with the React router library, it starts to feel like Rails in a way, setting up routes and views, and rendering html and styling with css for those "views" or components as they are called in React. The React docs explain components the best: "Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation". They are easy to use and easy to configure. I find it fun just messing around in React and it reminds me of mod 2 just learning Rails for the first time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Capstone Project

This project lasted all six weeks of the module, our cohort was split up into three teams with different projects, two of which were meant to communicate with each other. I was on team Enroll, which was an active enrollment app for Turing stufents. We were asked to implement new features as well as modify functionality so that it could integrate with the Census project, the new authorization service for meant for most if not all Turing apps.

My main contributions were in the DevOps realm: setting up the app as well as the old auth service 'Apply' in a staging environment, congiuring auto-deployment, continuous integration testing(CI), and working with a third app, the Dashboard, which was a React app written by a Front End Engineering student and configuring auto-deploy and CI in that app as well. I also helped fix the test suite which had numerous failures when we inherited the code, as well as worked on the smart search feature for the admin dashboard of the Enroll app.       

### Enroll

* Our Staging App in production [http://enroll-staging.turing.io/]
* The current Production App [https://github.com/turingschool/enroll]

__Project__ description:

Enroll is an enrollment app for new students. They must register through Apply authentication service before gaining access to Enroll. Future itertions will see Enroll use Census to auth instead of Apply.

__Project__ scores:


I'll just ramble for a while. I've decided that you were given some above average difficulty, but not impossible tasks. Everyone complains about Josh Cheek's code, but I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility of things you'll find, especially in the open source world. I've found that gems and libraries are written by people that are just coding all the time, and they need to keep themselves interested.

The real struggle that I stepped into was process. Our goal was to simulate how projects are really done in the working world, and your process was holding you back. Communication between the different roles on the team, staff and student, was broken. People didn't know what others were thinking, how to get their questions across, or how to communicate progress and blockers. I can't say who's fault that is, but I'm big on personal responsibility, so I'll just say it was everyone's fault.

There are actually still improvements to be made to our communication and workflow. With all that said, I went back into manager mode, and I was strict about deliverables and adherence to the workflow I've communicated, and you guys bounced back quickly. I want you to ramp up even more in the last two weeks of the project, but I'm proud of what you delivered this week and how you delivered it. You're making lasting impact on your own careers, and the cogs that make Turing run.

### 1. Project Management

* **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.**
* 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized.
* 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.
* 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

### 2. Completion & Pace

* 4: Team is on track to complete all stories and has tracked/completed chores and/or laid out future stories.
* **3: Team is on track to complete all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.**
* 2: Team is on track to complete a subset of user stories after an approved cutting of the work scope.
* 1: Team is not on track to complete the agreed-upon stories.

### 3. Implementation Quality

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* **3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**
* 2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or application of MVC principles.
* 1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of MVC.

### 4. Application of Techniques

* 4: Project has implemented two or more major techniques from the previous two weeks of academic classes.
* **3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.**
* 2: Project has an implementation in progress of one major technique from the previous two weeks of classes.
* 1: Project has a plan to implement a technique from academic classes.

### Open Source Contributions

Original Assignment - [http://backend.turing.io/module4/projects/the-plan/assignments/open-source]

#### Habitica

 * GitHub [https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica]
 
 Habitica is essentially a task management tool wrapped in a fun, collaborative "game" for the web and mobile. There are rewards in game for completing tasks and going on quests with friends. I attempted to install Habitica but ran into issues (crashed my comp three times) but also did not allocate the full suggested 4GB of swap data in my hard drive. I abandonded it given the deliverable timeline, but I will absolutely continue to work on Habitica as I am interested in front end frameworks and this project uses Angular. 

#### Figaro

* Link to Docs PR [https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/pull/258]

I have used Figaro alot in projects and think it is a very useful tool. It is very easy to use and has great docs, which is why I chose to make a Documentation PR to Figaro to include a helpful heroku command - heroku config - to display variables in the command line, very handy when deploying code to different environments and doing DebOps work, I probably typed heroku config 100 times this mod.

And yes, they require a gif in every PR... according to [https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md]

* Reproducing an issue/commenting on open source [https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro/issues/247]

I paired with Goss on a Figaro issue regarding Figaro's test suite which seemed easy at the time but turned out to be quite difficult. While we were successfully able to trace the issue, as seen by Goss's remarks we weren't able to quite solve the issue, but believe we know what is going wrong. This issue is something we will likely revisit, but will opt for the contriutions below as my code PR deliverable.

## D: Professional Skills

### Top three priorities in the job search

* Location: I would prefer to stay in Denver, I love living here and have been here for two years now. I have friends and family here so staying would be really nice, not having to move or radically change my life for a first dev job
* Flexible Schedule / Work - Life balance: I would like to work 40 hours a week at a company that offers flexible PTO and allows some form of remote work . I am a very active person and want to be able to travel and work from wherever I am. This is not ideal in the near future, but that is the goal
* Mentorship: I really would like a mentor or some sort of review so that I can gauge how well I am doing also and seek help or advice while on the job. 

### Action Plan
* Perceived barriers
 * New developer: show them my soft skills and ability to learn
 * Code School not CS degree: I have way more real-world code and working world experience than a CS degree

### Cold Outreach

I sent all six outreach emails and was able to set up two informational interviews. I sent basic email introducing myself, noting my interest in the Denver tech scene and the company that the person worked for. Then I gave a quick statement about my interests and requested a meeting.

### Blog Post and reviews

Blog Post [https://medium.com/@bheim67/rogue-bug-a-devops-story-1b83f6c1b1ce]

Review from Ryan Workman:
* Overall, that was a great post Brian.  Coming to the article with a bit of back knowledge regarding DevOps, it was interesting to see how my experience compared with dealing with Heroku and playing by their rules.  As a bit of feedback, I would suggest adding more "to-do" elements and less personal experience.  While I know this may seem difficult at this early stage in our careers, it's important to remember that most people haven't done half of the stuff you've done and are therefore looking for how to accomplish what you accomplished.

Review from Jean Joeris:
* The general topic is very clear in the first few sentences. However, it isn’t clear what the specifics are until the second section. I _love_ the title. The audience seems to be people new to dev ops. The beginning is explaining what dev ops is and what the project is, the middle is describing the bug and solution, and the end is take-aways and tips. There were no code snippets but they didn’t feel necessary. The language is mostly tight, but the following sentence stood out to me.:

I already didn’t know much about DevOps, but I learned that there is even more about DevOps that I didn’t know than I thought I didn’t know about DevOps.

This sentence is too long. At least one of the dev ops can be eliminated. I didn’t see any issues with punctuation. Overall the language is good. If I saw this post on medium I would want to click it, somewhat due to the awesome star wars pun in the title. I think that this article could be improved by some more specific scoping for audience. The article appears to have been logically edited and nothing stands out for needed removal

### Gear Up

#### MicroAggressions

Out of the three this was my least favorite Gear Up. I feel like I came away with a more ambiguous understanding of them than before. Many of the examples seemed more like either just plain old racism on one end, or on the other very gray statements that when said in different contexts and tones can have many different meanings. However, over time I can see how these can affect people and I will try my best to avoid them, even if I am being sincere: "Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret: the million other straws underneath it - it's all mathematics" - Mos Def 

* [Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions.markdown)


#### Journey Mapping

This Gear Up was fun. I liked improvising a little bit with asking the questions, it made the process light-hearted and insightful. I enjoyed workind in in teams and then splitting those teams. Very open conversation because the subject was very easy to talk about and not controversial which was nice.

* [Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)


#### Grit

I really enjoyed this Gear Up. I especially liked hearing what my croup members thoughts were on what Grit means, specifically the question asking what was your previous definition of grit and how/what does that word apply to you?

## F: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for David Davydov

*  I have worked with David before and know that he is an incredibly strong programmer with a very clear grasp of theory and technical knowledge. Unfortunately I did not get to work much directly with David on this project as our assigned tasks never overlapped. I always learned so much from David whenever we had paired in the past and having him as a Technical Lead for our team was very valuable. He took his role seriously and offered to help to Rapha and I with a refactor when working on the smart search feature. His implementation was brilliant and very clean, which is further proof to me of the truly great things David will achieve as a software developer.

#### Feedback for Jean Joeris

* I have worked with Jean before and know that he is a fantastic programmer with very strong technical skills. He also has great soft skills and is a pleasure to work with. Jean served as our Project Manager for the Enroll team and took on many different tasks in addition to writing code. He organized tasks on Tracker, communicated with our CTO and Product Owner for the team, and made sure the group was making progress. Even though I did not really work with him on the project code, Jean did a great job as PM; he reminded me (respectfully) about tasks I had forgotten about, and truly took his responsibility seriously. My only advice to Jean would be to not be too hard on himself regarding his PM duties. He mentioned to me that he felt he was not performing as well as he would like, but I thought he did a great job. I have alot of respect for Jean and can’t wait to see what he can do once we graduate.

#### Feedback for Raphael Barbo

* I have worked with Rapha before and it is always great to work with him. He and I work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair. Unfortunately I only got to work with Rapha for one afternoon on this project, but it was on a cool feature: the smart search, and was very rewarding. Rapha is a strong coder and has a relentless motor; he is always hungry for more code and new things to try. I look forward to seeing what he can accomplish after we leave Turing.

#### Feedback for Sonia Gupta

* This was my first time working with Sonia and it was a great experience. We ended up serving as the ‘DevOps’ team for our project and paired on most tasks. This was a new field of study for us and thus we were learning as we went. Working with a brownfield project as well as a totally new technology is quite challenging but Sonia and I were persistent and came away with alot of new knowledge. Sonia is a pleasure to pair with, she is very conscientious and seeks collaboration both when driving and navigating. She also kept a strong set of notes with useful commands and processes so that when we needed to revisit things, we did not have to waste time searching for solutions that we had already discovered. Sonia is also a strong programmer technically, and I feel we worked well as a team and complimented each other in terms of technical knowledge and skill; it always felt as though we were on “the same page”. My only advice to Sonia would be to put more trust in her intuition. There were times where she would second guess herself, but more often than not, her instincts were right. Sonia was awesome to work with and even though we worked on the most mystifying and at times frustrating portion of the project, we emerged successful and I am excited to see what Sonia can accomplish once we leave Turing.

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback for Brian (From Jean Joeris)

* Brian was a great team member. He worked with Sonia very hard on DevOps and handling our deployment, which was harder than anyone expected. Issues kept coming up, yet he was willing to continue troubleshooting as long as needed. I regret I didn't get to work with him more often on this project, as I know from Mind on The Ball we work excellent together. He was very hard working throughout and I'm glad he was on Enroll 

#### Feedback for Brian (From Sonia Gupta)

* Brian has been the person I worked with most on this project, and every moment was truly a pleasure. Even when we were frustrated, I always felt we were in it together. I had never worked with Brian before this project, and I am truly lucky to now have had the opportunity to do so. Brian has patience, resilience, and an incredibly upbeat personality. He allowed me to explore potential solutions even if they didn't work, and he never talked down to me. He treated me as an equal, and was incredibly respectful and compassionate. I learned from him how to have a sense of humor about our frustrations, and he kept me optimistic even when I felt downtrodden. I'm really grateful to Brian for his kindness and camaraderie. It means more than I can say. :)

#### Feedback for Brian (From Raphael Barbo)

* It is always a pleasure working with Brian, he brings such a positive attitude and great energy and I absolutely love it. He is always cheerful and has such a great attitude towards everything and everyone. During our pairing session throughout this project, Brian was able to break down problems into small manageable partitions, explain the process, and make sure we both understood what was going on in the code base. Brian and I both work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair, and that for me is just an amazing treat. I absolutely love working with Brian... Can't wait to see where his coding skills take him.

#### Feedback for Brian (From David Davydov)

* Brian, you've been working hard on this project from Day 1. I wish I had more of a chance to pair with you this time around. Having paired with you in the past, I know I missed out. You are always in a positive mood, and always have something cool to share. You stayed late, cranked code, fixed failing tests, and dug deep into complex gems. I was impressed by your taking on the TravisCI integration and then sharing your knowledge about it with the dashboard team. I'm happy to have gotten the opportunity to work with you, it's been a long journey but it's only just begun.


### Playing a Part

* Armstrong Posse - I contributed during the creation of our linear regression app, and some lesson plans. I participated regularly in posse meetings and discussions and aided posse leads in facilitating many sessions (firday spikes, meetings, lunches). Along with Jean Joeris created an app and built a neural net from scratch which will be used as a learning resource/example for the posse - update: Our presentation for MOTB won the Turing final Demo Day!
* Regularly empty dishes and load/run dishwashers (RIP) in big workspace
* Organized disc-golf outings with the #disc-golfers channel
* Served as a Pre-Work Guide for incomming students
