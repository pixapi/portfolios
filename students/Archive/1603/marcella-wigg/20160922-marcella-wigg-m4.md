# Marcella Wigg - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I was excited about learning JavaScript this module, because I am especially interested in working in it. Coming away from this module, I was able to successfully implement both GameTime and Ideabox and also managed to pass two technical challenges for jobs that involved JavaScript that resulted in offers, so I am quite happy with what I learned this module. Although it has been challenging to balance both completing sufficient work for module 4 and job searching at the same time, I feel very proud of what I have accomplished in regards to that balance.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3.5g
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3

* **D: Professional Skills**: 4
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

1. Satisfactory Progress - 3: Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with few bugs and no missing functionality. (In the real final assessment, this will involve completing one supporting feature.)

2. Ruby Syntax & Style - 3: Developer is able to write Ruby demonstrating a broad/deep understanding of available language features. Application demonstrates great understanding of Object-Oriented modeling. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

3. Rails Style & API - 3: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

4. Javascript Syntax & Style - 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

5. Testing - 4: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

6. User Interface - 3: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use

7. Workflow - 4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Lots of non-coding assignments this module. More than had been previously. I do not mind the variety, but only really had two large independent coding assignments.

#### Ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/bright-ones)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

Ideabox allows for recording ideas. In this project, we created a jQuery app that offered a responsive client-side interface using JavaScript and jQuery to implement filtering in the browser, and AJAX to communicate between client and server.

*** Very minor amending needs to be done and score will rise significantly when done :D See note below ***

### Week 5:
# Notes

Don’t be too hard on yourself re: ‘no where near being a portfolio piece’! Link to the blog post in the README, include some screenshots, include links to the way you PLAN for it to look - diagrams, code pens, whatever. Just because it isn’t ‘done’ doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be proud of it - and most people who are looking through your Github will take whatever is in the README as face value. You put a lot of work into this and stretched yourself :D

# Hours

56 total hours logged (between 7 to 8 hours a day)

# Code

Don’t forget to include a link to your blog post in the README for the repo.

PRs that have styling changes should, as a best practice, include a screen shot of the style change (or a gif if moving feature) https://github.com/marcellawigg/flashcards/pull/3 - Helps reviewers understand the style change without having to pull down and run the branch.

# Blog

`I did not attend the first lecture for React for my ScaleUp project, which ended up having a serious impact on my ability to efficiently set up my project with Webpack: how does one get started with React?` We dive immediately in to a few assumptions with this first sentence - Things that would be unclear to a non-turing reader that you might want to clarify - what is Scale Up, what is WebPack and how does it relate to React (Webpack is actually probably less common that using Browserify and Gulp - so it won’t be assumed that you’d use Webpack even for someone who knows what it is) - What project are you working on and why does it use React?

`which ultimately was not helpful to me when working in my IDE.` <- what is an IDE and why was this not helpful?

`option to view my app locally. ` <- might require more clarity? View it locally? Like look at the code? Maybe something like ‘I could write React code on my computer all ay, but I needed to be able to compile it so I could run it in the browser as I developed’

`(according to Quora users, at least) ` <- I love this. But seriously, good way to give context to your tech choices

Don’t forget to link to your repo in the blog post

### Blog Post (40 Points)  
  * 40: Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.

### Team Participation (40 points)

  * 40: Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.

### Hourly Work (30 points)

  * 30: Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.

### Risk Taking and Creativity (40 points)

  Instructor/Developer will select one feature in the project to review for this section of the rubric.

  * 40: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature or well documented spike. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

150/150

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had one main group project this module, which was GameTime. I worked with Nick Pisciotta to create a Frogger clone.

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/cake-walk)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This is Nick's and my reboot of the classic Frogger game, in which instead of a frog crossing a road, a child is dodging vegetables and gym equipment. Difficulty of the game increases as the player levels up due to increasing obstacle speed.

# Instructor Feedback

- Points: (base 150)

### Playability Features

We want your game to be full-featured and playable -- not just a proof of concept of the gameplay and rendering features.

To this end, make sure to include sufficient UX to allow the user to fully interact with the game. This would include:

- Indicate when the game is over and won or lost
- Allow the user to start a new game
- Include a clean UI surrounding the actual game interface itself
- Score Tracking: How this works will vary by game, but at the end of the game, generate a score for the winning player
- Scoreboard -- track scores across multiple game sessions. Since we aren't incorporating a server for our games, client-side storage like a cookie or LocalStorage will suffice.
- Create multiple rounds of difficulty. (consider increasing factors such as game speed, randomness of starting setup, etc)

### Features

* 35 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors
* **25 points - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs**
* 10 points - Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 0 points - Application crashes during normal usage

### User Interface

* **15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.**
* 10 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* 5 points - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
* 0 points - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

### Testing

* **30 points - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application and uses mocks and stubs when appropriate.**
* 25 points - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
* 10 points - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 0 points - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

### JavaScript Style

* 30 points - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components are separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
* **20 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 15 points - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or major bugs.
* 5 points - Your client-side application does not function. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.
* 0 points - There is little or no client-side code. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### Workflow

* **25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**
* 15 points - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
* 10 points - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
* 5 points - The developer commited the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
* 0 points - The application was not checked into version control.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* 15 points - Zero complaints
* **14 points - Five or fewer complaints**
* 5 points - Six to ten complaints
* 0 points - More than ten complaints

(See feedback section.)

## D: Professional Skills
These were somewhat helpful, especially the session we had with Jim yesterday. More of those, please. Need to start earlier with the professional development as I feel we did not get nearly enough.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

* (For Nick Pisciotta) Nick offers rare talent when it comes to programming: strong problem-solving skills and strong collaborative communication skills. I have been fortunate enough to work with him on two projects, and have been impressed with his strong problem-solving skills, the consistency of his contributions to projects (he delivers throughout the duration of the project), and his ability to provide constructive, actionable feedback. His dedication to projects has pushed me to work harder, and I am confident he would be an asset to any team he joins.
### Being a Community Member

* (From Nick Pisciotta) Marcella is a very strong programmer and incredibly hard working individual.  She gladly accepts any duty delegated to her, and will not rest until she figures out whatever challenge she's working on. I have worked with her on multiple projects while at Turing, and she always continues to produce high quality work with a can-do attitude. It has been great to work with Marcella, she thrives independently and in a group setting.

### Playing a Part

* Participated in Friday session on why Turing gets so many people complaining about lack of free speech, yet no one actually shows up for Gear Up sessions designed to listen to those issues.
* Suggested brown-bag lunch become option for students.
