# Ilana Corson - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I was able to work on Javascript. It was a great introduction into the powerful language. During Gametime, we were able to explore linked lists in Javascript, which was especially challenging. I was also able to polish my Module 3 project which took longer than I expected but I am happy with the result.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Notes:

- Did all the things!

### 1. Satisfactory Progress

* **3:** Developer completes iterations 1 through 5 with few bugs and no missing functionality. (In the real final assessment, this will involve completing one supporting feature.)

### 2. Ruby Syntax & Style

* **4:** Developer is able to write Ruby demonstrating a broad/deep understanding of available language features. Application demonstrates great understanding of Object-Oriented modeling. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 3. Rails Style & API

* **3:** Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 4. Javascript Syntax & Style

* **3:** Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 5. Testing

* **3:** Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.

### 6. User Interface

* **3:** The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

### 7. Workflow

* **4:** The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

This project utilized a rails backend with the use of Javascript and JQuery. The purpose was to learn about Javascript while working with a framework we are familiar with.

#### Instructor Evaluation Points

##### Specification Adherence

* **10 points**: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of `format.js` in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript. There are no front-end frameworks used in the application. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

* **5 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

#### Testing

* **8 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All controller actions are covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

#### Ruby and Rails Quality

* **9 points** - Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs. There _zero_ instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

#### JavaScript Style

* **8 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

#### Workflow

* **8 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Gametime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/1603-gametime)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This project was a JavaScript app where we created a game. It was a challenge to do the linked-list logic as well as the animations.

#### Rubric

##### Features

* **30 points** - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##### User Interface

* **15 points** - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

##### Testing

* **25 points** - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

##### JavaScript Style

* **20 points** - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow

* **25 points** - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* **15 points** - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

- This gear-up made me think about my workflow process and how I tend to bite off more than I can chew. The video gave me some insight into how I can waste less time. It also made me think about my emotional stability and how that could potentially effect my workflow.

#### There is an "I" in "Team"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

- This gear-up was a great way to get to know others in the community. Although the theme was pretty light, it allowed us as a group to get to know each other on a different level. Learning things about people by asking them interesting but non-threatening questions, is a great idea.#### There is an "I" in "Team"

#### Gear Up - The Gender Gap in Technology

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

- This gear-up gave me some insight into the tech community because I believe that it mimicked the real tech world. It was a little discouraging to see the lack of caring in our community. I believe that most people will take away something important from this, whether that be how to react to a situation or how not to be a certain way.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Negotiations

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/negotiations.md)

I learned that having a personal relationship with a company is the best way to get leads on a job. It is hard to negotiate with people who do not know you.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

- I worked with Charlie on Gametime. I was impressed with Charlie’s ability to pick up JavaScript so quickly. Our game involved a lot of logic pieces and although I was nervous about the logic, Charlie was able to wrap his head around it.
There were times when Charlie got a little ahead of himself and the solution was easier than it was originally thought.
Overall, Charlie was a great partner and we were able to support each other in things that we were uncomfortable with.

### Being a Community Member

- Charles Kaminer - Working with Ilana was as loud as one would expect.  We had a pretty good time all things considered and were able to put together a game to be proud of.  Ilana was supportive throughout the process and always willing to tackle problems head on.  We had a great partner balance and it was very nice being on the same page during those two weeks.

- Taylor Moore - Ilana is a gem to work with. I always find her passion and willingness to keep moving forward refreshing. Even when the going gets tough she perseveres. I suggested a challenge for her game time, not only did she take it on but she also owned it! I’m looking forward to having her on the team! So much time for additional poop conversations now.

### Playing a Part

- I ran the weekly impostors meeting
- I lead Pahlka posse
