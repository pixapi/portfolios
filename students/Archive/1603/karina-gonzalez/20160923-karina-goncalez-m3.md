## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
  I imagine that I am a plant.  Before Turing, I was simply a small indoor plant, I didn't really have to strain to get my bare minimum for survival.  At Turing, however, I feel as if there is a sun in some corner that is not necessarily out of reach and so my roots are being forced to plant themselves firmly as my stem intentionally grows upward.  During my time at Turing I've learned that my stem will inevitably wilt if I do not nurture it with time management, time management, and ... time management. My plant metaphor is getting a bit trite but the point is that, other than helping me get to my serving jobs on time, time never really seemed to serve a useful purpose to me in a previous life.  I honestly prided myself in getting lost in the moment, never really giving much attention to a system put in place to distract people from being present with one another. I find it funny, that's changed. I've always been driven by this desire to minimize that parasitic aspect of myself by giving back to my fellow humans-- in my previous life I would satisfy this aspect of myself by being a local activist, writing poetry, and attempting to live a conscientious life.  However, I now find myself in a position where I truly feel as if I could do *more* but that requires intention in the way I spend my time-- learning JavaScript, ajax, getting more familiar with the Rails Stack, showing up to class on time, being a part of technical groups who rely heavily upon my reliability.  These are responsibilities I, never imagined I would have and thus, am deeply grateful for.  This module was not only an iteration in my technical development but in my personal development as well.


### End of Module Assessment

Evaluation Scores:

* Ruby Style: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 2
* Testing: 2
* Progression/Completion: 3
* Workflow: 4

Notes:  

* Some formatting in your show. Should be moved to the model or a helper.
* Great internal API testing. You might consider DRYing out some of the tests. There's some common tasks here.
* Great service testing
* Great feature tests
* Exemplary internal API
* All tests passing!
* Great model. Could name class methods more like ActiveRecord.
* Let's about about strategies for passing two values from the model to the controller
* Could format the show page a little better, but not a problem.


### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### VolunteerCope (Self-Directed Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/volunteer_cope) - github repo
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Last time around module 3, I had my first go at volunteering to TA for the library's coding program, Try Turing, Hope House, and high school kids. I found it to be the most fulfilling when I was able to TA people from similar roots(lower income/diverse) for, in my opinion, the individuals that wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to code are the very ones that could be empowered by it the most.  That being said, I came into this module to find a more regular volunteering opportunity and was frustrated when I was unable to find a local program that specifically targeted lower income, diverse individuals.  So I decided to start something of my own.  I went to Pahlka with the idea and they liked it but decided that it would be my responsibility to seek the opportunity.  One thing led to another and I ended up finding the perfect outlet at the local Boys and Girls Club's Cope program where a Pahlka mentor, Kaitlin, is the only volunteer. Cope is a computer lab where children waiting for their parents to get out of work play minecraft after school.  Kaitlin has the children complete coding challenges before they are allowed to play.  However, being the only volunteer, it is difficult to effectively get a computer lab full of children engaged--  hence VolunteerCope.  It is an organizational tool for volunteers to make it more convenient for them to do so.  I spent more time than I probably should have at the actual program during personal project worktime, but this is a project that I will continue to maintain.

  * Test-Driven Development: 1
  * Code Quality: 3

  *Product Experience*
  * User Experience: 2
  * Performance: 3

**Evaluation Notes**

Notes:

Failing on production because of a user_id 'redirect-uri'
Saw interface on localhost:
UI is pleasant - seems to work well on local host minus the assigning a user to a lesson. Breaks when trying to sign up
Creating a new lesson/issue works well
Little bug after lesson is created it does not persist for a page reload.
Core feature is at about 90%
No tests - would like to see more - can't test Javascript at this point but Would like to sere service test and maybe log in and log out tests.

#### Apicurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/handroll_oauth)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

Apicurious consumes the Github API and recreates the user's Github profile page through API calls.  I decided to hand-roll my own oauth.


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Pivot (aka World Market) (with Kris Sparks Zachary Forbing & Christopher Concannon)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/the_pivot_1605)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot is a Module 3 assignment from the Turing School of Software and Design. The premise is that a team is given a code base from the final Module 2 project "Little Shop of Orders" and is required to "pivot" with the code base. Our new project involved building a marketplace of produce suppliers and items. The key requirements of the pivot are that no functionality can be lost from the original website, and layers of multitenancy are added.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* I completed *most* weekly survey for both SAB and staff purposes


### Being a Community Member

* From Deb: Karina - You have genuine depth, heart and madly good coding skills. You are fearless and strong, while being equally generous and kind. I learned a lot working with you on Rails Engine. You tackled coding challenges head on with confidence and stamina. You do spread youself a little thin at times, but that's just because you want to learn and do so many cool things in life. You CAN change the world. And you will be a legendary developer.

* From Kris(The Pivot) - 'Your contributions to the project were meaningful and significant. I've enjoyed working with you. I've also enjoyed problem-solving and learning with you. I think you have a strong grasp of many concepts and it would be great if you can continue to be patient with everyone who may not be as comfortable with certain things. I think you have a lot to contribute. It would be great to hear more from you in the early stages of a project. Thank you for all your work.' -Kris

* From Zach(The Pivot) -
Karina - Your code contributions are smart and invaluable to our project. Your work on the weather api, css, and business_items were particularly awesome. And you were there to help calm me down when I was stressed out. However, I'd like to see you be a little more consistent in your communication and attendance. I know that some things happened that were outside of your control, but I think that there were more beneficial actions for the group that you decided not to take. Your coding ability is strong, but I know you'll be even better if you can demonstrate a little more consistency.

### Playing a Part
* I was an active member of Pahlka Posse.   
* I provided weekly one-on-one support to Pahlka posse members.
* I joined Turing outreach last module and continued my participation in this module:  
    * TA'd at the Hope House.
* I paired with mod one students
* I was a Pre-work guide
* I volunteered at the Boys and Girls club Cope program in an effort to start a partnership between them and Turing.

### Gear Up

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie-- I specifically remember feeling excited that Black Girls who Code was a thing. I was in the group of people wanting to do something about it in our community-- we separated into smaller groups within our group and within mine, there was a majority of men.  I remember deeply appreciating how attentive they were when we spoke, we all practiced active listening and that made for a space where we all felt free to express our opinions on the lack of gender diversity in tech. 

#### There is an I in Team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I wasn't able to attend this session, it was labor day weekend and family had a weekend camping trip planned. I let all of my classmates now in our private channel as well as the instructors

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

I wasn't able to attend this session, I was still in the process of moving int he beginning of this module.
